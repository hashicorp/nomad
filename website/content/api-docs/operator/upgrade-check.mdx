# Upgrade Check Operator HTTP API

The `/operator/upgrade-check` endpoints provide some predefined verifications
that can be useful prior to upgrades and changes to Nomad configuration.

<Note>

These endpoints are meant to target specific releases of Nomad and may be
removed or modified without notice.

</Note>

## Vault Workload Identity

This endpoint retrieves jobs, nodes, and Vault ACL tokens that may be affected
when migrating a Nomad cluster to use [workload identities for
Vault][nomad_acl_vault_wid].

| Method | Path                                                 | Produces           |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/v1/operator/upgrade-check/vault-workload-identity` | `application/json` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/nomad/api-docs#blocking-queries) and
[required ACLs](/nomad/api-docs#acls).

| Blocking Queries | ACL Required    |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| `NO`             | `operator:read` |

#### Field Reference

- `JobsWithoutVaultIdentity` `(array<Job>)` - The list of jobs that have a
  [`vault`][] block but do not have an [`identity`][] for Vault
  authentication. These jobs can fail if they are not redeployed with an
  identity for Vault before the configuration for Nomad servers are updated and
  their access to Vault is removed.

- `OutdatedNodes` `(array<Node>)` - The list of nodes running a version of
  Nomad that does not support workload identity authentication for Vault.
  Allocations placed in these nodes will use the deprecated legacy flow to
  retrieve Vault tokens. If the Nomad servers configuration is update to remove
  their access to Vault before these nodes are upgraded, these allocations will
  fail. Allocations that use workload identity for Vault will not be able to be
  placed in these nodes until they are upgraded.

- `VaultTokens` `(array<VaultAccessor>)` - The list of Vault ACL tokens created
  by Nomad servers using the deprecated legacy flow. They will continue to work
  even after the migration to the workload identities, but they may not be
  automatically revoked by Nomad and will only expire once their TTL reaches
  zero.

Vault][nomad_acl_vault_wid_migrate] for more information.
