# Command: operator root keyring install

The `operator root keyring install` command installs a new encryption key used
for variables and workload identity signing. The key file must be a JSON file
previously written by Nomad to the keystore. The key file will be read from
stdin by specifying "-", otherwise a path to the file is expected.

If ACLs are enabled, this command requires a management token.
