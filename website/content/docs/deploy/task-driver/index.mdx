# Configure Nomad task drivers

Nomad's bundled task drivers integrate with the host OS to run job tasks in
isolation. Review driver capabilities, client configuration, and reference
information for the Docker, Isolated Fork/Exec, Java, QEMU, and Raw Fork/Exec
task drivers.

@include 'task-driver-intro.mdx'

## Configuration

Refer to the [plugin block documentation][plugin] for examples on how to use the
plugin block in Nomad's client configuration. Review the [Docker driver's client
requirements section][docker_plugin] for a detailed example.

## Nomad task drivers

The Nomad binary contains several bundled task drivers. We also support
additional task driver plugins that you may install separately.

| Bundled with Nomad   | Plugins               |
|----------------------|-----------------------|
| [Docker]             | [Exec2]               |
| [Isolated Fork/Exec] | [Podman]              |
| [Java]               | [Virt]                |
| [QEMU]               |                       |
| [Raw Fork/Exec]      |                       |

## Community task drivers

You may also use [community-supported task driver
plugins](/nomad/plugins/drivers/community/).

## Use task drivers in jobs

Refer to [Use Nomad task drivers in jobs](/nomad/docs/job-declare/task-driver)
for usage information.

## Create task drivers

Nomad's task driver architecture is pluggable, which gives you the flexibility
to create your own drivers without having to recompile Nomad. Refer to the
[plugin authoring guide][plugin_guide] for details.
