#### Nomad 1.8 deprecated `disconnect` fields removed

In Nomad 1.8, we introduced the `disconnect` block to replace the
`max_client_disconnect`, `stop_after_client_disconnect`, and
`prevent_reschedule_on_list` fields. In Nomad 1.10, we removed these fields, and
Nomad will ignore them if specified. Jobs should migrate to using the
[`disconnect` block](/nomad/docs/job-specification/disconnect) prior to upgrading.
