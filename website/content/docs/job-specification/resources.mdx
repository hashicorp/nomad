# `resources` Stanza

<Placement groups={['job', 'group', 'task', 'resources']} />

The `resources` stanza describes the requirements a task needs to execute.
Resource requirements include memory, CPU, and more.

```hcl
job "docs" {
  group "example" {
    task "server" {
      resources {
        cpu    = 100
        memory = 256

        device "nvidia/gpu" {
          count = 2
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## `resources` Parameters

- `cpu` `(int: 100)` - Specifies the CPU required to run this task in MHz.

- `cores` <code>(`int`: &lt;optional&gt;)</code> - Specifies the number of CPU cores to reserve
  for the task. This may not be used with `cpu`.

- `memory` `(int: 300)` - Specifies the memory required in MB.

- `memory_max` <code>(`int`: &lt;optional&gt;)</code> - Optionally, specifies the maximum memory the task may use, if the client has excess memory capacity, in MB.

- `device` <code>([Device][]: &lt;optional&gt;)</code> - Specifies the device
  requirements. This may be repeated to request multiple device types.

## `resources` Examples

The following examples only show the `resources` stanzas. Remember that the
`resources` stanza is only valid in the placements listed above.

### Cores

This example specifies that the task requires 2 reserved cores. With this stanza, Nomad will find
a client with enough spare capacity to reserve 2 cores exclusively for the task. Unlike the `cpu` field, the
task will not share cpu time with any other tasks managed by Nomad on the client.

```hcl
resources {
  cores = 2
}
```

If `cores` and `cpu` are both defined in the same resource stanza, validation of the job will fail.

### Memory

This example specifies the task requires 2 GB of RAM to operate. 2 GB is the
equivalent of 2000 MB:

```hcl
resources {
  memory = 2000
}
```

### Devices

This example shows a device constraints as specified in the [device][] stanza
which require two nvidia GPUs to be made available:

```hcl
resources {
  device "nvidia/gpu" {
    count = 2
  }
}
```
