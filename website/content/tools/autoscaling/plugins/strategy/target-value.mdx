# Target Value Strategy Plugin

The `target-value` strategy plugin performs count calculations in order to
keep the value resulting from the APM query at or around a specified target.

It accomplishes this by extrapolating the current metric value and used
capacity linearly to determine if a scaling action is required and how many
instances need to be added or removed. More specify, the new scaling value is
calculated as:

```
new_count = (current_metric_value / target) * current_count
```

As an example, a policy that tracks memory usage with target defined as `70`
(representing 70% of memory usage) and there are `10` instances running will
generate a scaling action to add `2` new instances when the metric reaches `80`
(80% of memory usage) because:

```
new_count = (80/70) * 10 = 11.43 ~= 12
```

In other words, if with 10 instances the memory usage in 80%, it's expected
that with 12 instances the memory usage is lower and closer to the target value
of 70%.

~> **Note:** In some situations this inverse relationship may not be true,
  meaning that _more_ instances causes the metric value to _grow_. Make sure
  you have a good grasp of your query result dynamic when the number of
  instances changes.

## Agent Configuration Options

```hcl
strategy "target-value" {
  driver = "target-value"
}
```

## Policy Configuration Options

```hcl
check "target-value-check" {
  # ...
  strategy "target-value" {
    target    = 20
    threshold = 0.0001
  }
  # ...
}
```

- `target` `(float: <required>)` - Specifies the metric value the Autoscaler
  should try to meet.

- `threshold` `(float: 0.01)` - Specifies how significant a change in the input
  metric should be considered. Small threshold values can lead to output
  fluctuation.
