# Sentinel Policies HTTP API

The `/sentinel/policies` and `/sentinel/policy/` endpoints are used to manage Sentinel policies.
For more details about Sentinel policies, please see the [Sentinel Policy Guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/nomad/governance-and-policy/sentinel).

Sentinel endpoints are only available when ACLs are enabled. For more details about ACLs, please see the [ACL Guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/nomad?track=acls#operations-and-development).

~> **Enterprise Only!** This API endpoint and functionality only exists in
Nomad Enterprise. This is not present in the open source version of Nomad.
