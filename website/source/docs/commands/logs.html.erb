# Command: logs

The `logs` command is used to stream logs of tasks. Nomad can only stream logs of
tasks which are either running or whose allocation has not been destroyed. Nomad 
currently streams only the log lines written to the stdout and stderr buffers.

## Usage

```
nomad logs --allocation [allocation-id] --task [task-name]
```

Nomad will stream the logs of the task in an allocation whose name and allocation id 
is passed along with the logs command. 

Nomad will only stream logs for allocations which are not in the `pending` state.


## General Options

<%= general_options_usage %>

## Logs Options

* `--stdout`: Streams the stdout logs

* `--stderr`: Streams the stdout logs 

* `--follow`: The command blocks until the allocation dies and continues to stream logs

* `--lines`: stream only the last `K` lines 


## Examples

Stream the logs written to stdout buffer: 

```
$ nomad logs --alloc 751d3ad3-a38c-5b53-e27a-04d812ac4dea --task redis --stdout 
```

Stream the logs written to stdout, stderr buffers and follow:

```
$ nomad logs --alloc 751d3ad3-a38c-5b53-e27a-04d812ac4dea --task redis --stdout --stderr --follow
```

Stream the last three lines from a running task and follow:

```
$ nomad logs --alloc 751d3ad3-a38c-5b53-e27a-04d812ac4dea --task redis --stdout --stderr --follow --lines 3
```
