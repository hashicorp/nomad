# /v1/operator

The `/operator` endpoint provides cluster-level tools for Nomad operators, such
as interacting with the Raft subsystem.

~> Use this interface with extreme caution, as improper use could lead to a
Nomad outage and even loss of data.

See the [Outage Recovery](https://learn.hashicorp.com/nomad/operating-nomad/outage) guide for some examples of how
these capabilities are used. For a CLI to perform these operations manually,
please see the documentation for the
[`nomad operator`](/docs/commands/operator) command.

## Read Raft Configuration

This endpoint queries the status of a client node registered with Nomad.

| Method | Path                              | Produces           |
| ------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/v1/operator/raft/configuration` | `application/json` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/api-docs#blocking-queries) and
[required ACLs](/api-docs#acls).

| Blocking Queries | ACL Required |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| `NO`             | `management` |

### Parameters

- `stale` - Specifies if the cluster should respond without an active leader.
  This is specified as a query string parameter.

### Sample Request

```shell
$ curl \
    https://localhost:4646/v1/operator/raft/configuration
```

### Sample Response

```json
{
  "Index": 1,
  "Servers": [
    {
      "Address": "127.0.0.1:4647",
      "ID": "127.0.0.1:4647",
      "Leader": true,
      "Node": "bacon-mac.global",
      "RaftProtocol": 2,
      "Voter": true
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Field Reference

- `Index` `(int)` - The `Index` value is the Raft corresponding to this
  configuration. The latest configuration may not yet be committed if changes
  are in flight.

- `Servers` `(array: Server)` - The returned `Servers` array has information
  about the servers in the Raft peer configuration.

  - `ID` `(string)` - The ID of the server. This is the same as the `Address`
    but may be upgraded to a GUID in a future version of Nomad.

  - `Node` `(string)` - The node name of the server, as known to Nomad, or
    `"(unknown)"` if the node is stale and not known.

  - `Address` `(string)` - The `ip:port` for the server.

  - `Leader` `(bool)` - is either "true" or "false" depending on the server's
    role in the Raft configuration.

  - `Voter` `(bool)` - is "true" or "false", indicating if the server has a vote
    in the Raft configuration. Future versions of Nomad may add support for
    non-voting servers.

## Remove Raft Peer

This endpoint removes a Nomad server with given address from the Raft
configuration. The return code signifies success or failure.

  to enable redundancy zones.

- `DisableUpgradeMigration` `(bool: false)` - (Enterprise-only) Disables Autopilot's

    }
  ]
}
```

- `Healthy` is whether all the servers are currently healthy.

- `FailureTolerance` is the number of redundant healthy servers that could be
  fail without causing an outage (this would be 2 in a healthy cluster of 5
  servers).

- `Servers` holds detailed health information on each server:

  - `ID` is the Raft ID of the server.

  - `Name` is the node name of the server.

  - `Address` is the address of the server.

  - `SerfStatus` is the SerfHealth check status for the server.

  - `Version` is the Nomad version of the server.

  - `Leader` is whether this server is currently the leader.

  - `LastContact` is the time elapsed since this server's last contact with the leader.

  - `LastTerm` is the server's last known Raft leader term.

  - `LastIndex` is the index of the server's last committed Raft log entry.

  - `Healthy` is whether the server is healthy according to the current Autopilot configuration.

  - `Voter` is whether the server is a voting member of the Raft cluster.

  - `StableSince` is the time this server has been in its current `Healthy` state.

  The HTTP status code will indicate the health of the cluster. If `Healthy` is true, then a
  status of 200 will be returned. If `Healthy` is false, then a status of 429 will be returned.
