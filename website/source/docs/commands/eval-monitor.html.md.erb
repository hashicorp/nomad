# Command: eval-monitor

The `eval-monitor` command is used to monitor an existing [evaluation](#).
Logs will be output describing state changes to the evaluation or its
associated [allocations](#). The monitor will exit when the evaluation
reaches a terminal state.

## Usage

```
nomad eval-monitor [options] <eval>
```

An evaluation ID or prefix must be provided. If there is an exact match, the
the evaluation will be monitored. Otherwise, a list of matching evaluations and
information will be displayed.

An interactive monitoring session will be started in the terminal. It is safe
to exit the monitor at any time using ctrl+c.

The command will exit when the given evaluation reaches a terminal
state (completed or failed). Exit code 0 is returned on successful
evaluation, and if there are no scheduling problems. If there are
job placement issues encountered (unsatisfiable constraints,
resource exhaustion, etc), then the exit code will be 2. Any other
errors, including client connection issues or internal errors, are
indicated by exit code 1.
