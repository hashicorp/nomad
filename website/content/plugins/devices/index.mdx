# Nomad device driver plugins

Use device driver plugins to detect physical hardware devices, such as graph
processing units (GPUs), a field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and universal
serial buses (USBs), on your Nomad clients. You can then use those devices in
your Nomad workloads.

By having extensible device plugins, Nomad has the flexibility
to support a broad set of devices and allows the community to build additional
device plugins as needed.

## Nomad device drivers

We support the [NVIDIA] device driver plugin, which you must install
separately. Refer to the [NVIDIA] documentation for instructions.

## Community Device Drivers

The community supports the [USB] device driver plugin.

## Create device drivers

Nomad's device driver architecture is pluggable, which gives you the flexibility
to create your own drivers without having to recompile Nomad. Refer to the
[plugin authoring guide][plugin_guide] for details.
