# Use dynamic host volumes

This page describes how to to create and configure a dynamic host volume and use
it to persist application data.

## Introduction

Nomad dynamic host volumes manage storage for stateful workloads without
requiring a restart of the Nomad nodes to apply configuration changes. They
provide a workload-agnostic way to specify resources and work with the `exec`,
`java`, and `docker` task drivers. You create dynamic host volumes via the CLI
or API and then configure the job with the
[`volume`](/nomad/docs/job-specification/volume) and
[`volume_mount`](/nomad/docs/job-specification/volume_mount) blocks in the job
specification.

Refer to the [dynamic host volume
specification][dhv_spec] for more information on specifying dynamic host
volumes.

## Requirements

A Nomad cluster v1.10.0 or greater with the Docker task driver enabled.

## Create the volume specification


Create a file with the name `volume.hcl`, add the following content to it, and
save the file.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="volume.hcl">

```hcl
namespace = "default"
name      = "example"
type      = "host"

# mkdir is the default built-in plugin
plugin_id = "mkdir"

# allows mounting by only one allocation at a time
capability {
  access_mode     = "single-node-single-writer"
  attachment_mode = "file-system"
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Create the volume.

```shell-session
$ nomad volume create ./volume.hcl
==> Created host volume example with ID 02eb1d8e-945e-50ee-7640-68b92f622870
  âœ“ Host volume "02eb1d8e" ready

    2025-01-21T14:56:35-05:00
    ID        = 02eb1d8e-945e-50ee-7640-68b92f622870
    Name      = example
    Namespace = default
    Plugin ID = mkdir
    Node ID   = d87c86d7-d22b-f811-c329-09e263995e86
    Node Pool = default
    Capacity  = 0 B
    State     = ready
    Host Path = /run/nomad/dev/alloc_mounts/02eb1d8e-945e-50ee-7640-68b92f622870
```

Verify the volume was fingerprinted on the node with the node ID from the output.

```shell-session
$ nomad node status -verbose d87c86d7-d22b-f811-c329-09e263995e86
...
Host Volumes
Name         ReadOnly  Source
example      false     /run/nomad/dev/alloc_mounts/02eb1d8e-945e-50ee-7640-68b92f622870
...
```

Set the volume ID as an environment variable.

```shell-session
$ VOLUME_ID=02eb1d8e-945e-50ee-7640-68b92f622870
```

## Create and run the job

The following job specification mounts the volume with the name `example` from
the dynamic host volume specification.

Create a file with the name `example.nomad.hcl`, add the following content to
it, and save the file.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="example.nomad.hcl">

```hcl
job "example" {

  group "group" {

    # claim the dynamic host volume for the allocation
    volume "groupvol" {
      type            = "host"
      source          = "example"
      access_mode     = "single-node-single-writer"
      attachment_mode = "file-system"
    }

    network {
      port "www" {
        to = 8001
      }
    }

    task "task" {

      driver = "docker"

      config {
        image   = "busybox:1"
        command = "httpd"
        args    = ["-vv", "-f", "-p", "8001", "-h", "/srv"]
        ports   = ["www"]
      }

      # mount the claimed volume to the task
      volume_mount {
        volume      = "groupvol"
        destination = "/srv"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Run the job.

```shell-session
$ nomad run ./example.nomad.hcl
```

## Interact with the host volume

Export the Allocation ID of the job into an environment variable with the name `ALLOC_ID`.

```shell-session
$ ALLOC_ID=$(nomad alloc status -t '{{ range . }}{{if eq .JobID "example"}}{{if eq .DesiredStatus "run"}}{{ .ID }}{{end}}{{end}}{{end}}')
```

Open a shell session in the allocation.

```shell-session
$ nomad alloc exec -job example /bin/sh
```

In the allocation's shell prompt, write a file to the mounted volume.

```shell-session
$ echo '<html>hello, world</html>' > /srv/index.html
```

Exit the allocation's shell session.

```shell-session
exit
```

Get the address of the HTTP server running in the allocation.

```shell-session
$ nomad alloc status $ALLOC_ID
...
Allocation Addresses (mode = "bridge"):
Label  Dynamic  Address
*www   yes      192.168.1.160:26512 -> 8001
```


Open the address in your web browser or use a tool like `curl` to see the change.

```shell-session
$ curl -s "http://192.168.1.160:26512"
<html>hello, world</html>
```

## Reschedule the allocation

Stop the allocation to force Nomad to reschedule it.

```shell-session
$ nomad alloc stop $ALLOC_ID
```

Open a shell session in the replacement allocation.

```shell-session
$ nomad alloc exec -job example /bin/sh
```

In the allocation's shell prompt, read the file previously written to the
mounted volume.

```shell-session
$ cat /srv/index.html
<html>hello, world</html>
```

Exit the allocation's shell session.

```shell-session
exit
```

## Clean up

Stop the `example` job.

```shell-session
$ nomad job stop example
```

Delete the dynamic host volume.

```shell-session
$ nomad volume delete -type host $VOLUME_ID
```
