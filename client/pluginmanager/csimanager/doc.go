/**
csimanager manages locally running CSI Plugins on a Nomad host, and provides a
few different interfaces.

It provides:
- a pluginmanager.PluginManager implementation that is used to fingerprint and
  heartbeat local node plugins
- (TODO) a csimanager.AttachmentWaiter implementation that can be used to wait for an
  external CSIVolume to be attached to the node before returning
- (TODO) a csimanager.NodeController implementation that is used to manage the node-local
  portions of the CSI specification, and encompassess volume staging/publishing
- (TODO) a csimanager.VolumeChecker implementation that can be used by hooks to ensure
  their volumes are healthy(ish)
