# Nomad volume specification `mount_options` block

<Placement
  groups={[
    ['volume', 'mount_options'],
  ]}
/>

Options for mounting `file-system` CSI volumes that don't already have a
pre-formatted file system. The `mount_options` block is not supported for
dynamic host volumes.

```hcl
id           = "ebs_prod_db1"
namespace    = "default"
name         = "database"
type         = "csi"
plugin_id    = "ebs-prod"
capacity_max = "200G"
capacity_min = "100G"

mount_options {
  fs_type     = "ext4"
  mount_flags = ["noatime"]
}
```

This block will be validated during volume creation against the `capability`
field. The `mount_options` provided in a job specification's [`volume`] block
will override this block. Consult the documentation for your storage provider
and CSI plugin as to whether these options are required or necessary.

## Parameters

- `fs_type` `(string <optional>)` - File system type (ex. `"ext4"`)
- `mount_flags` `([]string: <optional>)` - The flags passed to `mount` (ex.
  `["ro", "noatime"]`)
