This is a port of psutil (https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil). The challenge is porting all
psutil functions on some architectures.


Breaking Changes! golang 1.8 is required
-------------------------------------------

After v2.17.04, golang 1.8 is required to build.


Tag semantics
-------------------------

gopsutil tag policy is almost same as Semantic Versioning, but automatically increase like Ubuntu versioning.

for example, `v2.17.04` means

- v2: major version
- 17: release year, 2017
- 04: release month

gopsutil aims to keep backwards-compatiblity until major version change.

Taged at every end of month, but there are only a few commits, it can be skipped.


Available Architectures
------------------------------------

- FreeBSD i386/amd64/arm
- Linux i386/amd64/arm(raspberry pi)
- Windows/amd64
- Darwin i386/amd64
- OpenBSD amd64 (Thank you @mpfz0r!)
- Solaris amd64 (developed and tested on SmartOS/Illumos, Thank you @jen20!)

All works are implemented without cgo by porting c struct to golang struct.


Usage
---------

Note: gopsutil v2 breaks compatibility. If you want to stay with compatibility, please use v1 branch and vendoring.

.. code:: go

   package main

   import (
       "fmt"

       "github.com/shirou/gopsutil/mem"
   )

   func main() {
       v, _ := mem.VirtualMemory()

       // almost every return value is a struct
       fmt.Printf("Total: %v, Free:%v, UsedPercent:%f%%\n", v.Total, v.Free, v.UsedPercent)

       // convert to JSON. String() is also implemented
       fmt.Println(v)
   }

The output is below.

::

  Total: 3179569152, Free:284233728, UsedPercent:84.508194%
  {"total":3179569152,"available":492572672,"used":2895335424,"usedPercent":84.50819439828305, (snip...)}

You can set an alternative location to :code:`/proc` by setting the :code:`HOST_PROC` environment variable.

You can set an alternative location to :code:`/sys` by setting the :code:`HOST_SYS` environment variable.

You can set an alternative location to :code:`/etc` by setting the :code:`HOST_ETC` environment variable.

You can set an alternative location to :code:`/var` by setting the :code:`HOST_VAR` environment variable.

Documentation
------------------------

see http://godoc.org/github.com/shirou/gopsutil

Requirements
-----------------

- go1.7 or above is required.


More Info
--------------------

Several methods have been added which are not present in psutil, but will provide useful information.

- host/HostInfo()  (linux)

  - Hostname
  - Uptime
  - Procs
  - OS                    (ex: "linux")
  - Platform              (ex: "ubuntu", "arch")
  - PlatformFamily        (ex: "debian")
  - PlatformVersion       (ex: "Ubuntu 13.10")
  - VirtualizationSystem  (ex: "LXC")
  - VirtualizationRole    (ex: "guest"/"host")

- IOCounters

  - Label (linux only)    The registered `device mapper name <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-block-dm>`_

- cpu/CPUInfo()  (linux, freebsd)

  - CPU          (ex: 0, 1, ...)
  - VendorID     (ex: "GenuineIntel")
  - Family
  - Model
  - Stepping
  - PhysicalID
  - CoreID
  - Cores        (ex: 2)
  - ModelName    (ex: "Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2640M CPU @ 2.80GHz")
  - Mhz
  - CacheSize
  - Flags        (ex: "fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 ...")
  - Microcode

- load/LoadAvg()  (linux, freebsd)

  - Load1
  - Load5
  - Load15

- docker/GetDockerIDList() (linux only)

  - container id list ([]string)

- docker/CgroupCPU() (linux only)

  - user
  - system

- docker/CgroupMem() (linux only)

  - various status

- net_protocols (linux only)

  - system wide stats on network protocols (i.e IP, TCP, UDP, etc.)
  - sourced from /proc/net/snmp

- iptables nf_conntrack (linux only)

  - system wide stats on netfilter conntrack module
  - sourced from /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_count

Some codes are ported from Ohai. many thanks.
