# Web UI keyboard commands reference

The Nomad Web UI supports keyboard shortcut commands to help you navigate and
operate Nomad. You can use keyboard commands to inspect jobs, view logs,
monitor evaluations, and more.

## Open the shortcuts panel

Type a question mark (`?`) on any web UI page to display the
**Keyboard Shortcuts** panel. The available shortcuts and their corresponding
commands are shown in the table below. To use commands with two letters
separated by a space, type the letters one after the other.

|Shortcut|Keyboard command|
|---|---|
|Go to the **Jobs** page|`g j`|
|Go to the **Storage** page|`g r`|
|Go to the **Variables** page|`g v`|
|Go to the **Servers** page|`g s`|
|Go to the **Clients** page|`g c`|
|Go to the **Topology** page|`g t`|
|Go to the **Evaluations** page|`g e`|
|Go to the **Profile** page|`g p`|
|Go to the **Administration** page|`g a`|
|Next Subnav|`Shift + right arrow`|
|Previous Subnav|`Shift + left arrow`|
|Previous Main Section|`Shift + up arrow`|
|Next Main Section|`Shift + down arrow`|
|Show Keyboard Shortcuts|`?`|

## Toggle shortcut tooltip hints

Hold the `Shift` key on any page in the web UI to overlay inline tooltip hints.
Tooltips are contextual and will only show certain hints when applicable.

## Disable shortcuts

1. Open the **Keyboard Shortcuts** panel.
1. At the bottom of the panel, click on the toggle next to the
**Keyboard shortcuts enabled** option.

## Re-bind shortcuts

You can re-bind a shortcut with the following steps:

1. Open the **Keyboard Shortcuts** panel.
1. Click on the key combination next to the shortcut that you want to re-bind.
1. Type the new key combination.

To reset the key combination, click on the red **reset to default** text next
to the key combination that you want to reset.

## Traverse lists quickly

The web UI has pages that display a lot of data in list form. To navigate to a
specific item in the list, hold the `Shift` key and type the corresponding
number in the tooltip hint next to the item that you want to navigate to. Note
that items with a single digit require a leading zero (0).
