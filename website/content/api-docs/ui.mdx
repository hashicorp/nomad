## Exec Job

This page will show a side bar navigation to traverse the job's task groups and tasks. The majority of this page is a latent terminal window. Using the side bar navigation will transition to the exec task page which establishes a `nomad exec` connection.

This page is meant to be rendered in a popup window.

| Path               | Produces    |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| `/ui/exec/:job_id` | `text/html` |

### Parameters

- `allocation` `(string: "")` - An allocation ID that specifies which allocation to exec into.

## Exec Task Group

This page will show a side bar navigation to traverse the job's task groups and tasks with the selected task group already open. The majority of this page is a latent terminal window. Using the side bar navigation will transition to the exec task page which establishes a `nomad exec` connection.

This page is meant to be rendered in a popup window.

### Parameters

- `allocation` `(string: "")` - An allocation ID that specifies which allocation to exec into.

## Exec Task

This page will show a side bar navigation to traverse the job's task group's tasks. The majority of this page is a terminal window. The terminal window will be prepopulated with a `nomad exec` command. The specific command used to establish an interactive connection can be modified (e.g., changing `/bin/bash` to `/bin/sh`). Upon submitting the command, a websocket connection is opened to facilitate bidirectional communication between this terminal window and the task running on a Nomad client.

## ACL Tokens

This page lets you enter an ACL token (both accessor ID and secret ID) to use with the UI.
If the cluster does not have ACLs enabled, this page is unnecessary. If the cluster has an
anonymous policy that grants cluster-wide read access, this page is unnecessary. If the
anonymous policy only grants partial read access, then providing an ACL Token will
authenticate all future requests to allow read access to additional resources.
