# Deployments HTTP API

The `/deployment` endpoints are used to query for and interact with deployments.

## List Deployments

This endpoint lists all deployments.

| Method | Path              | Produces           |
| ------ | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/v1/deployments` | `application/json` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/api-docs#blocking-queries) and
[required ACLs](/api-docs#acls).

| Blocking Queries | ACL Required         |

| `YES`            | `namespace:read-job` |

### Parameters

- `prefix` `(string: "")`- Specifies a string to filter deployments based on
  an ID prefix. Because the value is decoded to bytes, the prefix must have an
  even number of hexadecimal characters (0-9a-f) .This is specified as a query
  string parameter.

### Sample Request

```shell
$ curl \
    https://localhost:4646/v1/deployments

## Fail Deployment

This endpoint is used to mark a deployment as failed. This should be done to
force the scheduler to stop creating allocations as part of the deployment or to
cause a rollback to a previous job version. This endpoint only triggers a rollback
if the most recent stable version of the job has a different specification than
the job being reverted.

| Method | Path                                 | Produces           |
| ------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| `POST` | `/v1/deployment/fail/:deployment_id` | `application/json` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/api-docs#blocking-queries) and
[required ACLs](/api-docs#acls).

  "DeploymentModifyIndex": 20,
  "RevertedJobVersion": 1,
  "Index": 20
}
```

## Promote Deployment

This endpoint is used to promote task groups that have canaries for a
deployment. This should be done when the placed canaries are healthy and the
rolling upgrade of the remaining allocations should begin.

| Method | Path                                    | Produces           |

| Blocking Queries | ACL Required           |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| `NO`             | `namespace:submit-job` |

### Parameters

- `:deployment_id` `(string: <required>)`- Specifies the UUID of the deployment.
  This must be the full UUID, not the short 8-character one. This is specified
  as part of the path and JSON payload.

- `All` `(bool: false)` - Specifies whether all task groups should be promoted.

- `Groups` `(array<string>: nil)` - Specifies a particular set of task groups
  that should be promoted.

### Sample Payload

```javascript
{
  "DeploymentID": "5456bd7a-9fc0-c0dd-6131-cbee77f57577",
  "All": true
}
```

```javascript
{
  "DeploymentID": "5456bd7a-9fc0-c0dd-6131-cbee77f57577",
  "Groups": ["web", "api-server"]
}
```

### Sample Request

```shell
$ curl \
    --request POST \
    https://localhost:4646/v1/deployment/promote/5456bd7a-9fc0-c0dd-6131-cbee77f57577
```

### Sample Response

```json
{
  "EvalID": "0d834913-58a0-81ac-6e33-e452d83a0c66",
  "EvalCreateIndex": 20,
  "DeploymentModifyIndex": 20,
  "Index": 20
}
```

## Set Allocation Health in Deployment

This endpoint is used to set the health of an allocation that is in the
deployment manually. In some use cases, automatic detection of allocation health
may not be desired. As such those task groups can be marked with an upgrade
policy that uses `health_check = "manual"`. Those allocations must have their
health marked manually using this endpoint. Marking an allocation as healthy
will allow the rolling upgrade to proceed. Marking it as failed will cause the
deployment to fail. This endpoint only triggers a rollback if the most recent stable
version of the job has a different specification than the job being reverted.

| Method | Path                                              | Produces           |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `POST` | `/v1/deployment/allocation-health/:deployment_id` | `application/json` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/api-docs#blocking-queries) and
[required ACLs](/api-docs#acls).

| Blocking Queries | ACL Required           |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| `NO`             | `namespace:submit-job` |

### Parameters

- `:deployment_id` `(string: <required>)`- Specifies the UUID of the deployment.
  This must be the full UUID, not the short 8-character one. This is specified
  as part of the path and the JSON payload.

- `HealthyAllocationIDs` `(array<string>: nil)` - Specifies the set of
  allocation that should be marked as healthy.

- `UnhealthyAllocationIDs` `(array<string>: nil)` - Specifies the set of
  allocation that should be marked as unhealthy.

### Sample Payload

```javascript
{
  "DeploymentID": "5456bd7a-9fc0-c0dd-6131-cbee77f57577",
  "HealthyAllocationIDs": [
    "eb13bc8a-7300-56f3-14c0-d4ad115ec3f5",
