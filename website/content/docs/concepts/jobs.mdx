# Jobs

This page explains the concept of a job, which is the Nomad construct for
deploying your app and its configuration.


## Background

A job is a declarative specification of tasks that Nomad should run. Each job
can have one or more task groups, which are collections of one or more tasks.

Declare the the desired state of your job in a job specification that describes
the type of job, the tasks and resources necessary for the job to run, and job
information such as which clients it can run on. Refer to the [Job
Specification](/nomad/docs/job-specification) for complete details and examples.

When you submit your job specification, Nomad creates a job along with
[allocations](/nomad/docs/glossary#allocation) for each group defined in the
spec. Nomad makes sure the actual state matches your desired state.

## Job types

Nomad supports the following job types:

- Batch

  Batch jobs are for short lived jobs that run until they exit
  successfully. Batch jobs are paramaterized or periodic.
    - Paramaterized: The paramaterized type accepts required or optional inputs. Trigger this job with the `job dispatch` [command](/nomad/docs/commands/job/dispatch).
    - Periodic: The periodic type is a Nomad cron job that runs at configured times.

- Service

  Service jobs are for long lived services that run until explicitly
  stopped. Use a service job type for your app and its resources.

- Sysbatch

  Sysbatch jobs are for run-once commands that should run on every node in the
  cluster. These jobs run until explicitly stopped by an operator, evicted
  through preemption, or successful completion.

- System

  System jobs run on all clients that meet the job's constraints. Use a system
  job for deploying and managing tasks that should be present on every node in
  the cluster.

Refer to the [Schedulers](/nomad/docs/schedulers) page for details on how Nomad schedules each of these job types.

## Job statuses

After you submit your job, Nomad assigns a status to indicate how a job is
performing. This status is based on running, healthy [allocations](/nomad/docs/glossary#allocation) versus desired job state.

All jobs may have the following statuses in the Nomad UI:

- Degraded: A deployment is not taking place. Some allocations are failed, lost, or unplaced.
- Deploying: A [deployment](/nomad/docs/glossary#deployment) is actively taking place.
- Failed: All allocations are failed, lost, or unplaced.
- Healthy: All expected allocations are running and healthy.
- Recovering: Some allocations are pending.
- Removed: The job appeared in the initial query but has since been garbage
  collected. This happens when the user remains on the page for a long time.
- Stopped: A user has has manually stopped the job. It has not yet been purged or garbage collected.

Batch and sysbatch jobs may have these additional statuses:

- Complete: All expected allocations are complete.
- Running: All expected allocations are running.
