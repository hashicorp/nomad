# `resources` Stanza

<Placement groups={['job', 'group', 'task', 'resources']} />

The `resources` stanza describes the requirements a task needs to execute.
Resource requirements include memory, CPU, and more.

```hcl
job "docs" {
  group "example" {
    task "server" {
      resources {
        cpu    = 100
        memory = 256

        device "nvidia/gpu" {
          count = 2
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## `resources` Parameters

- `cpu` `(int: 100)` - Specifies the CPU required to run this task in MHz.

- `cores` <code>(`int`: &lt;optional&gt;)</code> <sup>1.1 Beta</sup> - Specifies the number of CPU cores to reserve
  for the task. This may not be used with `cpu`.

- `memory` `(int: 300)` - Specifies the memory required in MB.

- `memory_max` <code>(`int`: &lt;optional&gt;)</code> <sup>1.1 Beta</sup> - Optionally, specifies the maximum memory the task may use, if the client has excess memory capacity, in MB. See [Memory Oversubscription](#memory-oversubscription) for more details.

- `device` <code>([Device][]: &lt;optional&gt;)</code> - Specifies the device
  requirements. This may be repeated to request multiple device types.

## `resources` Examples

The following examples only show the `resources` stanzas. Remember that the
`resources` stanza is only valid in the placements listed above.

### Cores

This example specifies that the task requires 2 reserved cores. With this stanza, Nomad will find
a client with enough spare capacity to reserve 2 cores exclusively for the task. Unlike the `cpu` field, the
task will not share cpu time with any other tasks managed by Nomad on the client.

```hcl
resources {
  cores = 2
}
```

If `cores` and `cpu` are both defined in the same resource stanza, validation of the job will fail.

### Memory

This example specifies the task requires 2 GB of RAM to operate. 2 GB is the
equivalent of 2000 MB:

```hcl
resources {
  memory = 2000
}
```

### Devices

This example shows a device constraints as specified in the [device][] stanza
which require two nvidia GPUs to be made available:

```hcl
resources {
  device "nvidia/gpu" {
    count = 2
  }
}
```
## Memory Oversubscription

Setting task memory limits requires balancing the risk of interrupting tasks
against the risk of wasting resources. If a task memory limit is set too low,
the task may exceed the limit and be interrupted; if the task memory is too
high, the cluster is left underutilized.

To help maximize cluster memory utilization while allowing a safety margin for
unexpected load spikes, Nomad 1.1. lets job authors set two separate memory
limits:

* `memory`: the reserve limit to represent the task’s typical memory usage —
  this number is used by the Nomad scheduler to reserve and place the task

* `memory_max`: the maximum memory the task may use, if the client has excess
  available memory, and may be terminated if it exceeds

If a client's memory becomes contended or low, the operating system will
pressure the running tasks to free up memory. If the contention persists, Nomad
may kill oversubscribed tasks and reschedule them to other clients. The exact
mechanism for memory pressure is specific to the task driver, operating system,
and application runtime.

The new max limit attribute is currently supported by the official `docker`,
`exec`, and `java` task drivers.  Consult the documentation of
community-supported task drivers for their memory oversubscription support.

Memory oversubscription is opt-in. Nomad operators can enable [Memory Oversubscription in the scheduler
configuration](/api-docs/operator/scheduler#update-scheduler-configuration). Enterprise customers can use [Resource
Quotas](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/nomad/quotas) to limit the memory
oversubscription.

To avoid degrading the cluster experience, we recommend examining and monitoring
resource utilization and considering the following suggestions:

* Set `oom_score_adj` for Linux host services that aren't managed by Nomad, e.g.
  Docker, logging services, and the Nomad agent itself. For Systemd services, you can use the [`OOMScoreAdj` field](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/blob/v1.0.0/dist/systemd/nomad.service#L25).

* Monitor hosts for memory utilization and set alerts on Out-Of-Memory errors

* Set the [client `reserved`](/docs/configuration/client#reserved) with enough
  memory for host services that aren't managed by Nomad as well as a buffer
  for the memory excess. For example, if the client reserved memory is 1GB,
  the allocations on the host may exceed their soft memory limit by almost
  1GB in aggregate before the memory becomes contended and allocations get
  killed.
