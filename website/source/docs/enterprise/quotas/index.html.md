# Nomad Enterprise Resource Quotas

In [Nomad Enterprise](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/nomad/), operators can
define [quota specifications](/guides/quotas.html) and apply them to namespaces.
When a quota is attached to a namespace, the jobs within the namespace may not
consume more resources than the quota specification allows.

This allows operators to partition a shared cluster and ensure that no single
actor can consume the whole resources of the cluster.
