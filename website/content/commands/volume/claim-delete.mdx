# `nomad volume claim delete` command reference

The `volume claim delete` command deletes a task group host volume claim.
[Stateful deployments][stateful deployments] use these claims.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad volume claim delete [options] <claim_id>
```

This command accepts claim ID or prefix as the sole argument. The command
deletes the claim if there is an exact match based on the provided claim
ID or prefix, Otherwise, the command displays a list of matching claims and
information.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the
`host-volume-write` capability in the volume's namespace.

## Options

- `-y`: Automatically answers "yes" to all the questions, making the deletion
  non-interactive. Defaults to "false."

## Example

List all volumes.

```shell-session
$ nomad volume claim delete 3f25be9a

  If you delete a volume claim, the allocation that uses this claim to "stick"
  to a particular volume ID will no longer use it upon its next reschedule or
  migration. The deployment of the task group the allocation runs will still
  claim another feasible volume ID during reschedule or replacement.
