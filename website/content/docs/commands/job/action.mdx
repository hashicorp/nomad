# Command: job action

**Alias: `nomad action`**

The `job action` command allows operators to execute predefined actions specified
in Nomad job specifications. These actions can be defined at task level and are
intended for specific operational tasks, such as clearing a cache, or migrating
a database.

An action may self-terminate upon completion (for example, echoing a string),
or run for an indeterminate amount of time (for example, watching a blocking
query). In the latter case, an action can be terminated via escape character
(such as cmd+c / ctrl+c)

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the `alloc-exec`,
`read-job`, and `list-jobs` capabilities for the allocation's namespace. If
the task driver does not have file system isolation (as with `raw_exec`),
this command requires the `alloc-node-exec`, `alloc-exec`, `read-job`, and
`list-jobs` capabilities for the allocation's namespace.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad job action [options]
```

The `job action` command requires an action name and accepts two ways of
specifying where it should be run:
- by passing the job name and known allocation ID along with the name of the action
- by passing the job, task group, and task name along with the name of the action
(when the allocation ID is not known). A random allocation will be selected if
multiple are available.

The action name provided must be defined within a task in the [job specification]
provided. With sufficient privileges, an execution context will be opened and
the defined action command will be run. No further input is possible, save for
the escape character to terminate execution, so interactive commands are not
supported.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Action Options

- `-job`: (Required) Specifies the job containing the predefined action. This
  is the job under which the task is registered.

- `-alloc`: Specifies the allocation within which the action is to be executed.
  If omitted, either a task-group and task-name must be provided, and a random
  allocation will be selected from them.

- `-task`: (Required if no allocation is specified) Specifies the task within
  the job where the action is defined. This must correspond to a task in the job's
  specification.

- `-group`: (Required if no allocation is specified) Specifies the task group 
  within the job. This is needed when selecting a random allocation from a
  specific task.

- `-i`: Pass stdin to the container, defaults to true. Pass `-i=false` to
  disable explicitly.

- `-t`: Allocate a pseudo-tty, defaults to true if stdin is detected to be a tty
  session. Pass `-t=false` to disable explicitly.

- `-e` <escape_char>: Sets the escape character for sessions with a pty
  (default: '~'). The escape character is only recognized at the beginning of a
  line. The escape character followed by a dot ('.') closes the connection.
  Setting the character to 'none' disables any escapes and makes the session
  fully transparent.

## Examples

Execute an action within a specific task in a job:

```shell-session
$ nomad action \
  -group=my-group \
  -task=my-task \
  -job=my-job \
  weather

Toronto: ☁️   +3°C
``````

Execute an action within a specific allocation:

```shell-session
$ nomad action \
  -alloc=alloc123 \
  -job=actions-demo \
  echo-time
