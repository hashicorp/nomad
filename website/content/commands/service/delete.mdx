# `nomad service delete` command reference

The `service delete` command is used to delete an individual service
registration. <em>This command is not expected to be used during normal
operations of Nomad and should be used with caution.</em>

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad service delete [options] <service_name> <service_id>
```

The `service delete` command requires two arguments, the name of the service
and the ID of the individual registration to delete.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the `submit-job`
capability for the service registration namespace.

## Examples

Delete a service registration:

```shell-session
$ nomad service delete example-cache-redis _nomad-task-a831f7f2-4c01-39dc-c742-f2b8ca178a49-redis-example-cache-redis-db
Successfully deleted service registration
```
