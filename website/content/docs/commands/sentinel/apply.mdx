# Command: sentinel apply

The `sentinel apply` command is used to write a new, or update an existing,
Sentinel policy.

~> Sentinel commands are new in Nomad 0.7 and are only available with Nomad
Enterprise.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad sentinel apply [options] <Policy Name> <Policy File>
```

The `sentinel apply` command requires two arguments, the policy name and the
policy file. The policy file can be read from stdin by specifying "-" as the
file name.

Sentinel commands are only available when ACLs are enabled. This command
requires a management token.

## General Options

@include 'general_options_no_namespace.mdx'

## Apply Options

- `-description` : Sets a human readable description for the policy

- `-scope` : (default: submit-job) Sets the scope of the policy and when it
  should be enforced.

- `-level` : (default: advisory) Sets the enforcement level of the policy. Must
  be one of advisory, soft-mandatory, hard-mandatory.

## Examples

Write a policy:

```shell-session
$ nomad sentinel write -description "My test policy" foo test.sentinel
Successfully wrote "foo" Sentinel policy!
```
