## 1.3.1 (May 19, 2022)

SECURITY:

* A vulnerability was identified in the go-getter library that Nomad uses for its artifacts such that a specially crafted Nomad jobspec can be used for privilege escalation onto client agent hosts. [CVE-2022-30324](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-30324) [[GH-13057](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/13057)]

BUG FIXES:

* agent: fixed a panic on startup when the `server.protocol_version` config parameter was set [[GH-12962](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/12962)]

## 1.3.0 (May 11, 2022)

FEATURES:

* **Edge compute improvements**: Added support for reconnecting healthy allocations when disconnected clients reconnect. [[GH-12476](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/12476)]
* **Native service discovery**: Register and discover services using builtin simple service discovery. [[GH-12368](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/12368)]

BREAKING CHANGES:

* agent: The state database on both clients and servers will automatically migrate its underlying database on startup. Downgrading to a previous version of an agent after upgrading it to Nomad 1.3 is not supported. [[GH-12107](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/12107)]
* client: The client state store will be automatically migrated to a new schema version when upgrading a client. Downgrading to a previous version of the client after upgrading it to Nomad 1.3 is not supported. To downgrade safely, users should erase the Nomad client's data directory. [[GH-12078](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/12078)]
* connect: Consul Service Identity ACL tokens automatically generated for Connect services are now
created as Local rather than Global tokens. Nomad clusters with Connect services making cross-Consul
datacenter requests will need to ensure their Consul agents are configured with anonymous ACL tokens
of sufficient node and service read permissions. [[GH-8068](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/8068)]
* connect: The minimum Consul version supported by Nomad's Connect integration is now Consul v1.8.0. [[GH-8068](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/8068)]
* csi: The client filesystem layout for CSI plugins has been updated to correctly handle the lifecycle of multiple allocations serving the same plugin. Running plugin tasks will not be updated after upgrading the client, but it is recommended to redeploy CSI plugin jobs after upgrading the cluster. [[GH-12078](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/12078)]
* raft: The default raft protocol version is now 3 so you must follow the [Upgrading to Raft Protocol 3](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/upgrade#upgrading-to-raft-protocol-3) guide when upgrading an existing cluster to Nomad 1.3.0. Downgrading the raft protocol version is not supported. [[GH-11572](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/11572)]
