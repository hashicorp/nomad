# Nomad quickstart

These installations are designed to get you started with Nomad and should
be used only for experimentation purposes. If you are looking to install Nomad
in production, refer to the [Production Installation
guide](/nomad/docs/install/production).

## Nomad tutorials

We recommend these tutorials, which provision a Nomad cluster for you.

- [Get Started][]: Get up and running with Nomad by learning about scheduling,
  setting up a cluster, and deploying an example job. Create a Nomad cluster
  on your local machine or in an AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
  cloud environment. This tutorial series has an associated code repository so
  you can review the Terraform provisioning scripts and Nomad job specifications.
- [Cluster Setup][]: Provision a Nomad cluster on AWS, Azure, or GCP. Enable
  Consul and access control lists (ACLs). This tutorial series has an associated
  code repository so you can review the Terraform provisioning scripts.
- [Enable gossip encryption for Nomad][interactive]: Launch an interactive lab
  to use Nomad in your browser.

## Cloud installation

The Nomad repository contains guides and Terraform scripts for provisioning a
Nomad sandbox environment on AWS, Azure, or GCP with Consul and Vault. You can
explore Nomad and its integrations with the HashiCorp stack.

## Local installation

Use one of the following methods to run a local Nomad sandbox environment:

- Install a binary

  Refer to the [Install Nomad guide][installing-binary] to install the latest
  Nomad release binary.

  Run Nomad with the `sudo nomad agent -dev` [command][agent-dev], which
  starts the Nomad agent in development mode.

  If you are using Docker Desktop for Windows or MacOS, refer to [How to connect
  to my host network when using Docker Desktop (Windows and MacOS)][faq-win-mac]
  for instructions on binding Nomad to a non-loopback network interface.

- Use Vagrant and VirtualBox

  This option requires AMD hardware.

  The Nomad repository contains a Vagrantfile. Refer to the [Developing with
  Vagrant section][vagrant] of the [Nomad Codebase
  Documentation][compile-source] file for instructions.

- Compile and run from source

  This option requires software engineering experience and a workstation set up
  for Go, Node, and Docker development.

  Refer to the Nomad repository's [Nomad Codebase Documentation][compile-source]
  file for details.
