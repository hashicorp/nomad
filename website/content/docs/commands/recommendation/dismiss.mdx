# Command: recommendation dismiss

The `recommendation dismiss` command is used to dismiss recommendations.

~> Recommendation commands are new in Nomad 1.0 and are only available with
Nomad Enterprise.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad recommendation dismiss [options] <recommendation_ids>
```

The `recommendation dismiss` command requires at least one recommendation ID
to be passed to it. Multiple IDs can be passed, with each recommendation ID
separated from the next by a space.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the `submit-job`,
`read-job`, and `submit-recommendation` capabilities for the recommendation's
namespace.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Examples

Dismiss a single recommendation:

```shell-session
$ nomad recommendation dismiss a9c041c5-3c04-aa24-bd55-0a80cded4f10
Successfully dismissed recommendation
```
