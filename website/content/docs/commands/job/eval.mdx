# Command: job eval

The `job eval` command is used to force an evaluation of a job, given the job
ID.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad job eval [options] <job_id>
```

The `job eval` command requires a single argument, specifying the job ID to
evaluate. If there is an exact match based on the provided job ID, then the job
will be evaluated, forcing a scheduler run.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the `submit-job`
capability for the job's namespace.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Eval Options

- `-force-reschedule`: `force-reschedule` is used to force placement of failed
  allocations. If this is set, failed allocations that are past their reschedule
  limit, and those that are scheduled to be replaced at a future time are placed
  immediately. This option only places failed allocations if the task group has
  rescheduling enabled.

- `-detach`: Return immediately instead of monitoring. A new evaluation ID
  will be output, which can be used to examine the evaluation using the
  [eval status] command.

- `-verbose`: Show full information.

## Examples

Evaluate the job with ID "job1":

```shell-session
$ nomad job eval job1
==> Monitoring evaluation "0f3bc0f3"
    Evaluation triggered by job "test"
    Evaluation within deployment: "51baf5c8"
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "0f3bc0f3" finished with status "complete"
```

Evaluate the job with ID "job1" and return immediately:

```shell-session
$ nomad job eval -detach job1
Created eval ID: "4947e728"
```

Evaluate the job with ID "job1", and reschedule any eligible failed allocations:

```shell-session
$ nomad job eval -force-reschedule job1
==> Monitoring evaluation "0f3bc0f3"
    Evaluation triggered by job "test"
    Evaluation within deployment: "51baf5c8"
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "0f3bc0f3" finished with status "complete"
```
