# Target Value Strategy Plugin

The `target-value` strategy plugin will perform count calculations in order to
keep the value resulting from the APM query at or around a specified target.

## Agent Configuration Options

```hcl
strategy "target-value" {
  driver = "target-value"
}
```

## Policy Configuration Options

```hcl
check "target-value-check" {
  # ...
  strategy "target-value" {
    target    = 20
    threshold = 0.0001
  }
  # ...
}
```

- `target` `(float: <required>)` - Specifies the metric value the Autoscaler
  should try to meet.

- `threshold` `(float: 0.01)` - Specifies how significant a change in the input
  metric should be considered. Small threshold values can lead to output
  fluctuation.
