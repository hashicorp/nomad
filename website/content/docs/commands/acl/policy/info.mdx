# `nomad acl policy info` command reference

The `acl policy info` command is used to fetch information on an existing ACL
policy.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad acl policy info <name>
```

The `acl policy info` command requires the policy name.

This command requires a management ACL token or a token that has the
associated policy.

## General options

@include 'general_options_no_namespace.mdx'

## Examples

Fetch information on an existing ACL Policy:

```shell-session
$ nomad acl policy info my-policy
Name        = my-policy
Description = <none>
CreateIndex = 749
ModifyIndex = 758

Rules

{
  "Name": "my-policy",
  "Description": "This is a great policy",
  "Rules": "list_jobs"
}
```

If the ACL Policy is associated with a [Workload Identity][], additional information will be shown:

```shell-session
$ nomad acl policy info my-policy
Name        = my-policy
Description = <none>
CreateIndex = 749
ModifyIndex = 758

Associated Workload

Task      = redis

Rules

{
  "Name": "my-policy",
  "Description": "This is a great policy",
  "Rules": "list_jobs"
}
```
