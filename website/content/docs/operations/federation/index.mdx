## Operational Considerations

When operating multi-region federated Nomad clusters, the following considerations are important to
keep in mind:

* **Regular snapshots**: Nomad server state can be backed up using the
  [`nomad operator snapshot save`][] and [`nomad operator snapshot agent`][] commands. Performing
  regular backups can expedite disaster recovery and the cadence depends on cluster rates of change
  and your internal SLA’s. Snapshots should also be tested regularly using the
  [`nomad operator snapshot restore`][] command to ensure they work.

* **Local ACL management tokens**: In order to perform federated cluster administration when the
  authoritative region is down, local management tokens are required. It is important to have
  existing “break glass” tokens for each region available.

* **Known paths to creating local ACL tokens**: If the authoritative region fails, creation of
  global ACL tokens will fail. If this happens, having the ability to create local ACL tokens will
  allow you to continue to interact with each available federated region.

## FAQ

* **Can the authoritative region be deployed with servers only?** Yes, deploying the Nomad
  authoritative region with servers only (no Nomad clients) will work as expected. It can expedite
  disaster recovery of the region because restoration does not include objects such as nodes, jobs,
  or allocations which are large and require compute intensive reconciliation after restoration.

* **Can I migrate the authoritative region to a currently federated region?** It is possible by
  following the steps below:

  * Update the [`authoritative_region`][] configuration parameter on the desired authoritative
    region servers.

  * Restart the server processes in the new authoritative region and ensure all data is present in
    state as expected. If the network was partitioned as part of the failure of the original
    authoritative region, writes of replicated objects may not have been successfully replicated to
    federated regions.

  * Update the [`authoritative_region`][] configuration parameter on the federated region servers
    and restart their processes.

* **Can federated regions be bootstrapped while the authoritative region is down?**  No they
cannot.
