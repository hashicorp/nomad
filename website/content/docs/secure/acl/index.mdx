# ACL system overview

The ACL system is designed to be intuitive, high-performance, and to provide
administrative insight. At the highest level, there are three major components to
the ACL system: tokens, policies, and capabilities. The components are
illustrated in the diagram below.

that those policies encapsulate capabilities like "Allow Submit Job" or "Allow
Query Nodes"][img_acl_overview]][img_acl_overview]

## Core objects overview

- **Tokens** - Requests to Nomad are authenticated using a bearer token.
  Each ACL token has a public Accessor ID which is used to name a token and a
  Secret ID which is used to make requests to Nomad. The Secret ID is provided
  using a request header (`X-Nomad-Token`) and is used to authenticate the
  caller. Tokens are either `management` or `client` types. The `management`
  tokens are effectively "root" in the system and can perform any operation.
  The `client` tokens are associated with one or more ACL policies which grant
  specific capabilities.

- **Policies** - Policies consist of a set of rules defining the capabilities or
  actions to be granted. For example, a "readonly" policy might only grant the
  ability to list and inspect running jobs, but not to submit new ones. No
  permissions are granted by default, making Nomad a default-deny system.

  - **Rules** - Policies are comprised of one or more rules. The rules define
    the capabilities of a Nomad ACL token for accessing the objects in a Nomad
    cluster, objects like namespaces, node, agent, operator, quota, etc. The
    full set of rules are discussed in a later section.

- **Capabilities** - Capabilities are the set of actions that can be performed.
  This includes listing jobs, submitting jobs, querying nodes, etc. A
  `management` token is granted all capabilities, while `client` tokens are
  granted specific capabilities via ACL policies. The full set of capabilities
  is discussed in the rule specifications.

## ACL policies

An ACL policy is a named set of rules. Each policy must have a unique name, an
optional description, and a rule set. A client ACL token can be associated with
multiple policies; a request is allowed if _any_ of the associated policies
grant the capability. Management tokens cannot be associated with policies
because they are granted all capabilities.

The special `anonymous` policy can be defined to grant capabilities to anonymous
requests. An anonymous request is a request made to Nomad without the
`X-Nomad-Token` header specified. This can be used to allow anonymous users to
list jobs and view their status, while requiring authenticated requests to
submit new jobs or modify existing jobs. By default, there is no `anonymous`
policy set meaning all anonymous requests are denied.

## ACL tokens

ACL tokens are used to authenticate requests and determine if the caller is
authorized to perform an action. Each ACL token has a public Accessor ID which
is used to identify the token, a Secret ID which is used to make requests to
Nomad, and an optional human readable name. All `client` type tokens are
associated with one or more policies and can perform an action if any
associated policy allows it. Tokens can be associated with policies which do not
exist, which are the equivalent of granting no capabilities. The `management`
type tokens cannot be associated with policies, but can perform any action.

When ACL tokens are created, they can be optionally marked as `Global`. This
causes them to be created in the authoritative region and replicated to all
other regions. Otherwise, tokens are created locally in the region the request
was made and not replicated. Local tokens cannot be used for cross-region
requests since they are not replicated between regions.

## Rules and scope

The following table summarizes the rules that are available for constructing
ACL policies:

| Rule                             | Scope                                        |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| [agent][rules_agent]             | Utility operations in the Agent API          |
| [host_volume][rules_host_volume] | Host Volume related operations               |
| [namespace][rules_namespace]     | Job related operations by namespace          |
| [node][rules_node]               | Node-level catalog operations                |
| [operator][rules_operator]       | Cluster-level operations in the Operator API |
| [plugin][rules_plugin]           | CSI Plugin related operations                |
| [quota][rules_quota]             | Quota specification related operations       |

Constructing policies from these rules is covered in detail in the
[Nomad ACL Policy Concepts guide][acl-policy-guide].

## Multi-Region configuration

Nomad supports multi-datacenter and multi-region configurations. A single region
is able to service multiple datacenters, and all servers in a region replicate
their state between each other. In a multi-region configuration, there is a set
of servers per region. Each region operates independently and is loosely coupled
to allow jobs to be scheduled in any region and requests to flow transparently
to the correct region.

When ACLs are enabled, Nomad depends on an "authoritative region" to act as a
single source of truth for ACL policies and global ACL tokens. The authoritative
region is configured in the [`server` stanza] of agents, and all regions must
share a single authoritative source. Any ACL policies or global ACL tokens are
created in the authoritative region first. All other regions replicate ACL
policies and global ACL tokens to act as local mirrors. This allows policies to
be administered centrally, and for enforcement to be local to each region for
low latency.

Global ACL tokens are used to allow cross-region requests. Standard ACL tokens
are created in a single target region and not replicated. This means if a
request takes place between regions, global tokens must be used so that both
regions will have the token registered.
