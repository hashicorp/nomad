# `nomad volume snapshot delete` command reference

The `volume snapshot delete` command deletes a snapshot of an existing
[Container Storage Interface (CSI)][csi] volume. Only CSI plugins that
implement the [Controller][csi_plugins_internals] interface support this
command.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad volume snapshot delete [plugin_id] [snapshot_id]
```

The `volume snapshot delete` command requires both the plugin ID and the
snapshot ID. The volume that was the source of the snapshot does not still
need to be [registered] with Nomad in order to be deleted.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the `csi-write-
volume` and `plugin:read` capabilities.

## General options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Snapshot delete options

- `-secret`: Secrets to pass to the plugin to delete the
  snapshot. Accepts multiple flags in the form `-secret key=value`

## Examples

Delete a volume snapshot:

```shell-session
$ nomad volume snapshot delete aws-ebs0 snap-12345
Deleted snapshot snap-12345.
```
