# `nomad volume delete` command reference

The `volume delete` command deletes storage volumes that are either [Container
Storage Interface (CSI)][csi] volumes or dynamic host volumes.

For CSI volumes, only CSI plugins that implement the
[Controller][csi_plugins_internals] interface support this command. The volume
is [deregistered][] when it is successfully deleted.

For dynamic host volumes, only volumes with plugins are deleted. Volumes without
plugins are deregistered without deleting them.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad volume delete [options] [volume]
```

The `volume delete` command requires a single argument, specifying the ID of
volume to be deleted. The volume must still be [registered][] with Nomad in
order to be deleted. Deleting fails if the volume is still in use by an
allocation or in the process of being unpublished.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the appropriate
capability in the volume's namespace: the `csi-write-volume` capability for CSI
volumes or `host-volume-delete` for dynamic host volumes.

## Options

- `-force`: Delete the volume from the Nomad state store if the node has been
  garbage collected. You should only use `-force` if the node will never rejoin
  the cluster. Only available for dynamic host volumes.

- `-secret`: Secrets to pass to the plugin to delete the snapshot. Accepts
  multiple flags in the form `-secret key=value`. Only available for CSI
  volumes.

- `-type`: Type of volume to delete. Must be one of "csi" or "host". Defaults to
  "csi".
