# Dynamic Application Sizing Average Strategy Plugin

<EnterpriseAlert>
  This functionality only exists in Nomad Autoscaler Enterprise. This is not
  present in the open source version of Nomad Autoscaler.
</EnterpriseAlert>

The `app-sizing-avg` plugin calculates the average value seen across the
historical metrics dataset. The plugin applies an exponential weight decay to
the data, in order to give more significance to recent data over older data.

This plugin is only recommended for CPU values of workloads with very stable
resource usage levels, such as batch jobs.

## Agent Configuration Options

The `app-sizing-avg` plugin is automatically launched by Nomad Autoscaler
Enterprise and so the following setup is optional.

```hcl
strategy "app-sizing-avg" {
  driver = "app-sizing-avg"
}
```

## Policy Configuration Options

```hcl
check "avg" {
  strategy "app-sizing-avg" {}
}
```

The `app-sizing-avg` plugin doesn't have any configuration.
