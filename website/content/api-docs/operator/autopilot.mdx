# Autopilot Operator HTTP API

The `/operator/autopilot` endpoints allow for automatic operator-friendly
management of Nomad servers including cleanup of dead servers, monitoring the
state of the Raft cluster, and stable server introduction.

## Read Autopilot Configuration

This endpoint retrieves its latest Autopilot configuration.

| Method | Path                                   | Produces           |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/v1/operator/autopilot/configuration` | `application/json` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/nomad/api-docs#blocking-queries) and
[required ACLs](/nomad/api-docs#acls).

| Blocking Queries | ACL Required    |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| `NO`             | `operator:read` |

### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ nomad operator api /v1/operator/autopilot/configuration
```

### Sample Response

```json
{
  "LastContactThreshold": "200ms",
  "ServerStabilizationTime": "10s",
  "CleanupDeadServers": true,
  "MaxTrailingLogs": 250,
  "MinQuorum": 2,
  "EnableRedundancyZones": false,
  "DisableUpgradeMigration": false,
  "EnableCustomUpgrades": false,
  "CreateIndex": 68,
  "ModifyIndex": 68
}
```

For more information about the Autopilot configuration options, see the
[agent configuration section](/nomad/docs/configuration/autopilot).

## Update Autopilot Configuration

This endpoint updates the Autopilot configuration of the cluster.

| Method | Path                                   | Produces           |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `PUT`  | `/v1/operator/autopilot/configuration` | `application/json` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/nomad/api-docs#blocking-queries) and
[required ACLs](/nomad/api-docs#acls).

| Blocking Queries | ACL Required     |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| `NO`             | `operator:write` |

### Parameters

- `cas` `(int: 0)` - Specifies to use a Check-And-Set operation. The update will
  only happen if the given index matches the `ModifyIndex` of the configuration
  at the time of writing.

### Sample Payload

```json
{
  "LastContactThreshold": "200ms",
  "ServerStabilizationTime": "10s",
  "CleanupDeadServers": true,
  "MaxTrailingLogs": 250,
  "MinQuorum": 2,
  "EnableRedundancyZones": false,
  "DisableUpgradeMigration": false,
  "EnableCustomUpgrades": false
}
```

- `CleanupDeadServers` `(bool: true)` - Specifies automatic removal of dead
  server nodes periodically and whenever a new server is added to the cluster.

- `LastContactThreshold` `(string: "200ms")` - Specifies the maximum amount of
  time a server can go without contact from the leader before being considered
  unhealthy. Must be a duration value such as `10s`.

- `MaxTrailingLogs` `(int: 250)` specifies the maximum number of log entries
  that a server can trail the leader by before being considered unhealthy.

- `MinQuorum` `(int: 0)` - Sets the minimum number of servers necessary in a
  cluster. Autopilot will stop pruning dead servers when this minimum is
  reached. There is no default.

- `ServerStabilizationTime` `(string: "10s")` - Specifies the minimum amount of
  time a server must be stable in the 'healthy' state before being added to the
  cluster. Only takes effect if all servers are running Raft protocol version 3
  or higher. Must be a duration value such as `30s`.

- `EnableRedundancyZones` `(bool: false)` - <EnterpriseAlert inline/> Specifies whether
  to enable redundancy zones.

- `DisableUpgradeMigration` `(bool: false)` - <EnterpriseAlert inline/> Disables Autopilot's
  upgrade migration strategy in Nomad Enterprise of waiting until enough
  newer-versioned servers have been added to the cluster before promoting any of
  them to voters.

- `EnableCustomUpgrades` `(bool: false)` - <EnterpriseAlert inline/> Specifies whether to
  enable using custom upgrade versions when performing migrations.

## Read Health

This endpoint queries the health of the autopilot status.

| Method | Path                            | Produces           |
| ------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/v1/operator/autopilot/health` | `application/json` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/nomad/api-docs#blocking-queries) and
[required ACLs](/nomad/api-docs#acls).

| Blocking Queries | ACL Required    |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| `NO`             | `operator:read` |

### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ nomad operator api /v1/operator/autopilot/health
```

### Sample response

- `Healthy` is whether all the servers are currently healthy.

- `FailureTolerance` is the number of redundant healthy servers that could be
  fail without causing an outage (this would be 2 in a healthy cluster of 5
  servers).

- `Servers` holds detailed health information on each server:

  - `ID` is the Raft ID of the server.

  - `Name` is the node name of the server.

  - `Address` is the address of the server.

  - `SerfStatus` is the SerfHealth check status for the server.

  - `Version` is the Nomad version of the server.

  - `Leader` is whether this server is currently the leader.

  - `LastContact` is the time elapsed since this server's last contact with the leader.

  - `LastTerm` is the server's last known Raft leader term.

  - `LastIndex` is the index of the server's last committed Raft log entry.

  - `Healthy` is whether the server is healthy according to the current Autopilot configuration.

  - `Voter` is whether the server is a voting member of the Raft cluster.

  - `StableSince` is the time this server has been in its current `Healthy` state.

The HTTP status code will indicate the health of the cluster. If `Healthy` is true, then a
status of 200 will be returned. If `Healthy` is false, then a status of 429 will be returned.

<EnterpriseAlert>
  This API endpoint returns with more information in Nomad Enterprise. This is
  not present in Nomad Community Edition.
</EnterpriseAlert>

When using Nomad Enterprise this endpoint will return more information about the
underlying actions and state of Autopilot.
