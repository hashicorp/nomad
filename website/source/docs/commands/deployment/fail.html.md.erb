# Command: deployment fail

The `deployment fail` command is used to mark a deployment as failed. Failing a
deployment will stop the placement of new allocations as part of rolling
deployment and if the job is configured to auto revert, the job will attempt to
roll back to a stable version.

## Usage

```
nomad deployment fail [options] <deployment id>
```

The `deployment fail` command requires a single argument, a deployment ID or
prefix. 

## General Options

<%= partial "docs/commands/_general_options" %>

## Fail Options

* `-detach`: Return immediately instead of monitoring. A new evaluation ID
  will be output, which can be used to examine the evaluation using the
  [eval-status](/docs/commands/eval-status.html) command.

* `-verbose`: Show full information.

## Examples

Manually mark an ongoing deployment as failed:

```
$ nomad deployment fail 8990cfbc
Deployment "8990cfbc-28c0-cb28-ca31-856cf691b987" failed

==> Monitoring evaluation "a2d97ad5"
    Evaluation triggered by job "example"
    Evaluation within deployment: "8990cfbc"
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "a2d97ad5" finished with status "complete"

$ nomad deployment status 8990cfbc
ID          = 8990cfbc
Job ID      = example
Job Version = 2
Status      = failed
Description = Deployment marked as failed

```
