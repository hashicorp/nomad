# `periodic` Stanza

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
  <tr>
    <th width="120">Placement</th>
    <td>
      <code>job -> **periodic**</code>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The `periodic` stanza allows a job to run at fixed times, dates, or intervals.
The easiest way to think about the periodic scheduler is "Nomad cron" or
"distributed cron".

```hcl
job "docs" {
  periodic {
    cron             = "*/15 * * * * *"
    prohibit_overlap = true
  }
}
```

The periodic expression by default evaluates in the **UTC timezone** to ensure
consistent evaluation when Nomad spans multiple time zones.

## `periodic` Requirements

 - The job's [scheduler type][batch-type] must be `batch`.
 - A job can not be updated to be periodically. Thus, to transition an existing job to be periodic, you must first run `nomad stop -purge «job name»`. This is expected behavior and is to ensure that this change has been intentionally made by an operator.

## `periodic` Parameters

- `cron` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies a cron expression configuring the
  interval to launch the job. In addition to [cron-specific formats][cron], this
  option also includes predefined expressions such as `@daily` or `@weekly`.

- `prohibit_overlap` `(bool: false)` - Specifies if this job should wait until
  previous instances of this job have completed. This only applies to this job;
  it does not prevent other periodic jobs from running at the same time.

- `time_zone` `(string: "UTC")` - Specifies the time zone to evaluate the next
  launch interval against. This is useful when wanting to account for day light
  savings in various time zones. The time zone must be parsable by Golang's
  [LoadLocation](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#LoadLocation).

## `periodic` Examples

The following examples only show the `periodic` stanzas. Remember that the
`periodic` stanza is only valid in the placements listed above.

### Run Daily

This example shows running a periodic job daily:

```hcl
periodic {
  cron = "@daily"
}
```

### Set Time Zone

This example shows setting a time zone for the periodic job to evaluate in:

```hcl
periodic {
  cron      = "*/15 * * * * *"
  time_zone = "America/New_York"
}
```
