# Command: ui

The `ui` command is used to open the Nomad Web UI.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad ui [options] <identifier>
```

The `ui` command can be called with no arguments, in which case the UI homepage
will be opened in the default browser.

An identifier may be provided, in which case the UI will be opened to view the
details for that object. Supported identifiers are jobs, allocations and nodes.

If ACLs are enabled, the web UI will start in an unauthenticated state and you
may see a 403 Unauthorized page if anonymous read access is denied. The `nomad ui -authenticate` option will exchange your command line client's Nomad ACL
token for a one-time token, which is passed to the web UI. That one-time token
will be exchanged for your Nomad ACL token and stored in the browser's local
storage for authentication.

## General Options

@include 'general_options_no_namespace.mdx'

## UI Options

- `-authenticate`: Exchange your Nomad ACL token for a one-time token in the
  web UI.

## Examples

Open the UI homepage:

```shell-session
$ nomad ui
Opening URL "http://127.0.0.1:4646"
```

Open the UI directly to look at a job:

```shell-session
$ nomad ui redis-job
http://127.0.0.1:4646/ui/jobs/redis-job
```

Open the UI directly to look at an allocation:

```shell-session
$ nomad ui d4005969
Opening URL "http://127.0.0.1:4646/ui/allocations/d4005969-b16f-10eb-4fe1-a5374986083d"
```

Open the UI and authenticate using your ACL token:

```shell-session
$ NOMAD_ACL_TOKEN=e9674b26-763b-4637-a28f-0df95c53cdda nomad ui -authenticate
Opening URL "http://127.0.0.1:4646" with token
```
