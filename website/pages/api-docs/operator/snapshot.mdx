# Snapshot Operator HTTP API

## Generate Snapshot

This endpoint generates and returns an atomic, point-in-time snapshot of the
Nomad server state for disaster recovery. Snapshots include all state managed by Nomad's
Raft [consensus protocol](/docs/internals/consensus).

Snapshots are exposed as gzipped tar archives which internally contain the Raft
metadata required to restore, as well as a binary serialized version of the
Nomad server state. The contents are covered internally by SHA-256 hashes.
These hashes are verified during snapshot restore operations. The structure of
the archive is internal to Nomad and not intended to be used other than for
restore operations. The archives are not designed to be modified before a
restore.

| Method | Path                    | Produces                 |
| :----- | :---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/v1/operator/snapshot` | `200 application/x-gzip` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/api-docs#blocking-queries) and
[required ACLs](/api-docs#acls).

| Blocking Queries | ACL Required |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| `NO`             | `management` |

### Parameters

- `stale` - Specifies if the cluster should respond without an active leader.
  This is specified as a query string parameter.

### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    -o snapshot.tgz \
    http://127.0.0.1:4646/v1/operator/snapshot
```

The above example results in a tarball named `snapshot.tgz` in the current working directory.

## Restore Snapshot

This endpoint restores a point-in-time snapshot of the Nomad server state.

Restores involve a potentially dangerous low-level Raft operation that is not
designed to handle server failures during a restore. This operation is primarily
intended to be used when recovering from a disaster, restoring into a fresh
cluster of Nomad servers.

The body of the request should be a snapshot archive returned from a previous
call to the `GET` method.

| Method | Path                    | Produces                      |
| :----- | :---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `PUT`  | `/v1/operator/snapshot` | `200 text/plain (empty body)` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/api-docs#blocking-queries) and
[required ACLs](/api-docs#acls).

| Blocking Queries | ACL Required |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| `NO`             | `management` |

### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --request PUT \
    --data-binary @snapshot.tgz \
    http://127.0.0.1:4646/v1/operator/snapshot
```

~> Some tools default to www/encoded uploads. Nomad expects the snapshot to be
in pure binary form.
