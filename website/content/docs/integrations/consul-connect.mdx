# Consul Service Mesh

~> **Note:** Nomad's service mesh integration requires Linux network namespaces.
Consul service mesh will not run on Windows or macOS.

[Consul service mesh](/consul/docs/connect) provides
service-to-service connection authorization and encryption using mutual
Transport Layer Security (TLS). Applications can use sidecar proxies in a
service mesh configuration to automatically establish TLS connections for
inbound and outbound connections without being aware of the service mesh at all.

# Nomad with Consul Service Mesh Integration

Nomad integrates with Consul to provide secure service-to-service communication
between Nomad jobs and task groups. To support Consul service mesh, Nomad
adds a new networking mode for jobs that enables tasks in the same task group to
share their networking stack. With a few changes to the job specification, job
authors can opt into service mesh integration. When service mesh is enabled, Nomad will
launch a proxy alongside the application in the job file. The proxy (Envoy)
provides secure communication with other applications in the cluster.

Nomad job specification authors can use Nomad's Consul service mesh integration to
implement [service segmentation](https://www.consul.io/use-cases/multi-platform-service-mesh) in a
microservice architecture running in public clouds without having to directly
manage TLS certificates. This is transparent to job specification authors as
security features in service mesh continue to work even as the application scales up
or down or gets rescheduled by Nomad.

For using the Consul service mesh integration with Consul ACLs enabled, see the
[Secure Nomad Jobs with Consul Service Mesh](/nomad/tutorials/integrate-consul/consul-service-mesh)
guide.

# Nomad Consul Service Mesh Example

The following section walks through an example to enable secure communication
between a web dashboard and a backend counting service. The web dashboard and
the counting service are managed by Nomad. Nomad additionally configures Envoy
proxies to run along side these applications. The dashboard is configured to
connect to the counting service via localhost on port 9001. The proxy is managed
by Nomad, and handles mTLS communication to the counting service.

## Prerequisites

### Consul

The Consul service mesh integration with Nomad requires [Consul 1.6 or
later.](https://releases.hashicorp.com/consul/1.6.0/) The Consul agent can be
run in dev mode with the following command:

~> **Note:** Nomad's Consul service mesh integration requires Consul in your `$PATH`

```shell-session
$ consul agent -dev
```

To use service mesh on a non-dev Consul agent, you will minimally need to enable the
GRPC port and set `connect` to enabled by adding some additional information to
your Consul client configurations, depending on format. Consul agents running TLS
and a version greater than [1.14.0](https://releases.hashicorp.com/consul/1.14.0)
should set the `grpc_tls` configuration parameter instead of `grpc`. Please see
the Consul [port documentation](https://nomadproject.io/consul_ports) for further reference material.

For HCL configurations:

```hcl
# ...

ports {
  grpc = 8502
}

connect {
  enabled = true
}
```

For JSON configurations:

```javascript
{
  // ...
  "ports": {
    "grpc": 8502
  },
  "connect": {
     "enabled": true
  }
}
```

#### Consul TLS

~> **Note:** Consul 1.14+ made a [backwards incompatible change][consul_grpc_tls]
in how TLS enabled grpc listeners work. When using Consul 1.14 with TLS enabled users
will need to specify additional Nomad agent configuration to work with Connect. The
`consul.grpc_ca_file` value must now be configured (introduced in Nomad 1.4.4),
and `consul.grpc_address` will most likely need to be set to use the new standard
`grpc_tls` port of `8503`.

```hcl
consul {
  grpc_ca_file = "/etc/tls/consul-agent-ca.pem"
  grpc_address = "127.0.0.1:8503"
  ca_file      = "/etc/tls/consul-agent-ca.pem"
  cert_file    = "/etc/tls/dc1-client-consul-0.pem"
  key_file     = "/etc/tls/dc1-client-consul-0-key.pem"
  ssl          = true
  address      = "127.0.0.1:8501"
}
```

#### Consul ACLs

~> **Note:** Starting in Nomad v1.3.0, Consul Service Identity ACL tokens automatically
generated by Nomad on behalf of Connect enabled services are now created in [`Local`]
rather than Global scope, and are no longer replicated globally.

To facilitate cross-Consul datacenter requests of Connect services registered by
Nomad, Consul agents will need to be configured with [default anonymous][anon_token]
ACL tokens with ACL policies of sufficient permissions to read service and node
metadata pertaining to those requests. This mechanism is described in Consul [#7414][consul_acl].
A typical Consul agent anonymous token may contain an ACL policy such as:

```hcl
service_prefix "" { policy = "read" }
node_prefix    "" { policy = "read" }
```

### Nomad

Nomad must schedule onto a routable interface in order for the proxies to
connect to each other. The following steps show how to start a Nomad dev agent
configured for Consul service mesh.

```shell-session
$ sudo nomad agent -dev-connect
```

### CNI Plugins

Nomad uses CNI plugins to configure the network namespace used to secure the
Consul service mesh sidecar proxy. All Nomad client nodes using network namespaces
must have CNI plugins installed.

The following commands install CNI plugins:

```shell-session
curl -L -o cni-plugins.tgz "https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/v1.0.0/cni-plugins-linux-$( [ $(uname -m) = aarch64 ] && echo arm64 || echo amd64)"-v1.0.0.tgz
sudo mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin
sudo tar -C /opt/cni/bin -xzf cni-plugins.tgz
```

Ensure the your Linux operating system distribution has been configured to allow
container traffic through the bridge network to be routed via iptables. These
tunables can be set as follows:

```shell-session
echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-arptables
echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-ip6tables
echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-iptables
```

To preserve these settings on startup of a client node, add a file including the
following to `/etc/sysctl.d/` or remove the file your Linux distribution puts in
that directory.

```
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
```

## Run the Service Mesh-enabled Services

Once Nomad and Consul are running, submit the following service mesh-enabled services
to Nomad by copying the HCL into a file named `servicemesh.nomad.hcl` and running:
`nomad job run servicemesh.nomad.hcl`

```hcl
job "countdash" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]

  group "api" {
    network {
      mode = "bridge"
    }

    service {
      name = "count-api"
      port = "9001"

      connect {
        sidecar_service {}
      }
    }

    task "web" {
      driver = "docker"

      config {
        image = "hashicorpdev/counter-api:v3"
      }
    }
  }

  group "dashboard" {
    network {
      mode = "bridge"

      port "http" {
        static = 9002
        to     = 9002
      }
    }

    service {
      name = "count-dashboard"
      port = "http"

      connect {
        sidecar_service {
          proxy {
            upstreams {
              destination_name = "count-api"
              local_bind_port  = 8080
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

    task "dashboard" {
      driver = "docker"

      env {
        COUNTING_SERVICE_URL = "http://${NOMAD_UPSTREAM_ADDR_count_api}"
      }

      config {
        image = "hashicorpdev/counter-dashboard:v3"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The job contains two task groups: an API service and a web frontend.

### API Service

The API service is defined as a task group with a bridge network:

```hcl
  group "api" {
    network {
      mode = "bridge"
    }

    # ...
  }
```

Since the API service is only accessible via Consul service mesh, it does not define
any ports in its network. The service block enables service mesh.

```hcl
  group "api" {

    # ...

    service {
      name = "count-api"
      port = "9001"

      connect {
        sidecar_service {}
      }
    }

    # ...

  }
```

The `port` in the service block is the port the API service listens on. The
Envoy proxy will automatically route traffic to that port inside the network
namespace. Note that currently this cannot be a named port; it must be a
hard-coded port value. See [GH-9907].

### Web Frontend

The web frontend is defined as a task group with a bridge network and a static
forwarded port:

```hcl
  group "dashboard" {
    network {
      mode = "bridge"

      port "http" {
        static = 9002
        to     = 9002
      }
    }

    # ...

  }
```

The `static = 9002` parameter requests the Nomad scheduler reserve port 9002 on
a host network interface. The `to = 9002` parameter forwards that host port to
port 9002 inside the network namespace.

This allows you to connect to the web frontend in a browser by visiting
`http://<host_ip>:9002` as show below:

[![Count Dashboard][count-dashboard]][count-dashboard]

The web frontend connects to the API service via Consul service mesh.

```hcl
    service {
      name = "count-dashboard"
      port = "http"

      connect {
        sidecar_service {
          proxy {
            upstreams {
              destination_name = "count-api"
              local_bind_port  = 8080
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
```

The `upstreams` block defines the remote service to access (`count-api`) and
what port to expose that service on inside the network namespace (`8080`).

The web frontend is configured to communicate with the API service with an
environment variable:

```hcl
      env {
        COUNTING_SERVICE_URL = "http://${NOMAD_UPSTREAM_ADDR_count_api}"
      }
```

The web frontend is configured via the `$COUNTING_SERVICE_URL`, so you must
interpolate the upstream's address into that environment variable. Note that
dashes (`-`) are converted to underscores (`_`) in environment variables so
`count-api` becomes `count_api`.

## Limitations

- The minimum Consul version to use Connect with Nomad is Consul v1.8.0.
- The `consul` binary must be present in Nomad's `$PATH` to run the Envoy
  proxy sidecar on client nodes.
- Consul service mesh using network namespaces is only supported on Linux.
- Prior to Consul 1.9, the Envoy sidecar proxy will drop and stop accepting
  connections while the Nomad agent is restarting.
