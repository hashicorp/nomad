# Command: server force-leave

The `server force-leave` command forces a server to enter the "left" state.
This can be used to eject server nodes which have failed and will not rejoin
the cluster. Note that if the server is actually still alive, it will
eventually rejoin the cluster again.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad server force-leave [options] <node>
```

This command expects only one argument - the node which should be forced
to enter the "left" state.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Examples

Force-leave the server "node1":

```shell-sessionnomad server force-leave node1

```
