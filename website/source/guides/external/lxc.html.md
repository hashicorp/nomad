  Guide for using LXC external task driver plugin.
---

## LXC

The `lxc` driver provides an interface for using LXC for running application
containers. You can download the external LXC driver
[here][lxc_driver_download]. This guide is compatible with Nomad 0.9 and above.
If you are using an older version of Nomad, see the [LXC][lxc-docs] driver
documentation.

## Reference Material

- Official [LXC][linux-containers] documentation
- Nomad [LXC][lxc-docs] external driver documentation

## Estimated Time to Complete

20 minutes

## Challenge

You need to deploy a workload using [Linux Containers][linux-containers-home].
Configure the client nodes that need to run this workload appropriately. You
will also need to install the `lxc-templates` package which will provide the
templates needed to start your containers.

## Solution

Install and configure the LXC external driver plugin. Verify the configuration
on the client node and deploy the application.

## Prerequisites

To perform the tasks described in this guide, you need to have a Nomad
environment with Consul installed. You can use this
[repo](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/tree/master/terraform#provision-a-nomad-cluster-in-the-cloud)
to easily provision a sandbox environment. This guide will assume a cluster with
one server node and one client node.

-> **Please Note:** This guide is for demo purposes and is only using a single
server node. In a production cluster, 3 or 5 server nodes are recommended.

## Steps

### Step 1: Verify Client Node Configuration

External drivers must be placed in the [plugin_dir][plugin_dir] directory which
defaults to [`data_dir`][data_dir]`/plugins`. Verify the `data_dir` directory on
the client node configuration. If you are using the environment provided by this
guide, the client configuration is located at `/etc/nomad.d/nomad.hcl`. The
configuration file will show you that the `data_dir` directory is
`/opt/nomad/data`. The relevant snippet of the configuration file is shown
below:

```shell
$ cat /etc/nomad.d/nomad.hcl 
data_dir = "/opt/nomad/data"
bind_addr = "0.0.0.0"
...
```

### Step 2: Install the `lxc` and `lxc-templates` Packages

Before we generate a Nomad job file and deploy our workload, we will need to
install the `lxc` and `lxc-templates` packages which will provide the runtime
and templates we need to start our container. Run the following command:

```shell
sudo apt install -y lxc lxc-templates
```

### Step 3: Download and Install the LXC Driver 

Make a directory called `plugins` in [data_dir][data_dir] (which is
`/opt/nomad/data` in our case) and download/place the [LXC
driver][lxc_driver_download] in it. The following sequences of commands
illustrate this process:

```shell
$ sudo mkdir -p /opt/nomad/data/plugins
$ curl -O https://releases.hashicorp.com/nomad-driver-lxc/0.1.0-rc2/nomad-driver-lxc_0.1.0-rc2_linux_amd64.zip
$ unzip nomad-driver-lxc_0.1.0-rc2_linux_amd64.zip 
Archive:  nomad-driver-lxc_0.1.0-rc2_linux_amd64.zip
  inflating: nomad-driver-lxc
$ sudo mv nomad-driver-lxc /opt/nomad/data/plugins
```
You can now delete the original zip file:

```shell
$ rm ./nomad-driver-lxc*.zip
```

### Step 4: Verify the LXC Driver Status

After completing the previous steps, you do not need to explicitly enable the
LXC driver in the client configuration, as it is enabled by default.

Restart the Nomad client service:

```shell
$ sudo systemctl restart nomad
```

After a few seconds, run the `nomad node status` command to verify the client
node is ready:

```shell
$ nomad node status
ID        DC   Name             Class   Drain  Eligibility  Status
81c22a0c  dc1  ip-172-31-5-174  <none>  false  eligible     ready
```

You can now run the `nomad node status` command against the specific node ID to
see which drivers are initialized on the client. In our case, the client node ID
is `81c22a0c` (your client node ID will be different). You should see `lxc`
appear in the `Driver Status` section as show below:

```shell
$ nomad node status 81c22a0c
ID            = 81c22a0c
Name          = ip-172-31-5-174
Class         = <none>
DC            = dc1
Drain         = false
Eligibility   = eligible
Status        = ready
Uptime        = 2h13m30s
Driver Status = docker,exec,java,lxc,mock_driver,raw_exec,rkt
...
```

### Step 5: Generate a Job File

Create a file named `lxc.nomad` and place the following contents in it:

```hcl
job "example-lxc" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
  type        = "service"

  group "example" {
    task "example" {
      driver = "lxc"

      config {
        log_level = "trace"
        verbosity = "verbose"
        template  = "/usr/share/lxc/templates/lxc-busybox"
      }

      resources {
        cpu    = 500
        memory = 256
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 6: Register the Nomad Job

Run the following command to register your Nomad job:

```shell
$ nomad run lxc.nomad
==> Monitoring evaluation "d8be10f4"
    Evaluation triggered by job "example-lxc"
    Allocation "4248c82e" created: node "81c22a0c", group "example"
    Allocation "4248c82e" status changed: "pending" -> "running" (Tasks are running)
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "d8be10f4" finished with status "complete"
```

### Step 7: Check the Status of the Job

You can run the following command to check the status of the jobs in your
cluster:

```shell
$ nomad status
ID           Type     Priority  Status   Submit Date
example-lxc  service  50        running  2019-01-28T22:05:36Z
```
As shown above, our job is successfully running. You can see detailed
information about our specific job with the following command:

```shell
$ nomad status example-lxc
ID            = example-lxc
Name          = example-lxc
Submit Date   = 2019-01-28T22:05:36Z
Type          = service
Priority      = 50
Datacenters   = dc1
Status        = running
Periodic      = false
Parameterized = false

Summary
Task Group  Queued  Starting  Running  Failed  Complete  Lost
example     0       0         1        0       0         0

Allocations
ID        Node ID   Task Group  Version  Desired  Status   Created    Modified
4248c82e  81c22a0c  example     0        run      running  6m58s ago  6m47s ago
```

## Next Steps

The LXC driver is enabled by default in the client configuration. In order to
provide additional options to the LXC plugin, add [plugin
options][lxc_plugin_options] `volumes_enabled` and `lxc_path` for the `lxc`
driver in the client's configuration file like in the following example: 

```hcl
plugin "nomad-driver-lxc" {
  config {
    enabled = true
    volumes_enabled = true
    lxc_path = "/var/lib/lxc"
  }
}
