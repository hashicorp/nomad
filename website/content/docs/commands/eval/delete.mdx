# Command: eval delete

The `eval delete` command is used to delete evaluations. It should be used
cautiously and only in outage situations where there is a large backlog of
evaluations not being processed. During most normal and outage scenarios,
Nomad's reconciliation and state management will handle evaluations as needed.

The eval broker is expected to be paused prior to running this command and
un-paused after. These actions can be performed by the
[`operator scheduler get-config`][scheduler_get_config]
and [`operator scheduler set-config`][scheduler_set_config] commands respectively.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad eval delete [options] [args]
```

It takes an optional argument which is the ID of the evaluation to delete. If
the evaluation ID is omitted, this command will use the filter flag to identify
and delete a set of evaluations.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a `management` token.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Delete Options

- `-filter`: Specifies an expression used to filter evaluations by for
  deletion.

- `-yes`: Bypass the confirmation prompt if an evaluation ID was not provided.

## Examples

Delete an evaluation using its ID:

```shell-session
$ nomad eval delete 9ecffbba-73be-d909-5d7e-ac2694c10e0c
Successfuly deleted 1 evaluation
```

Delete all evaluations with status `pending` for the `example` job:
```shell-session
$ nomad eval delete -filter='Status == "pending" and JobID == "example"'
Do you want to list evals (3) before deletion? [y/N] y

ID        Priority  Triggered By  Job ID   Namespace   Node ID   Status   Placement Failures
cef92121  50        job-register  example  default     <none>    pending  false
1c905ca0  50        job-register  example  default     <none>    pending  false
b9e77692  50        job-register  example  default     <none>    pending  false

Are you sure you want to delete 3 evals? [y/N] y

Successfuly deleted 3 evaluations
```

Delete all evaluations for the `system` and `service` whilst skipping all
prompts:
```shell-session
$ nomad eval delete -filter='Scheduler == "system" or Scheduler == "service"' -yes
Successfuly deleted 23 evaluations
```
