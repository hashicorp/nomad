# Benchmark and load test Nomad

The Nomad Bench project provides reusable infrastructure automation to run test
scenarios in order to collect metrics and data from Nomad clusters running at
scale. The core goal of the project is to achieve reproducible large scale test
scenarios so we can better understand how Nomad scales and uncover problems that
are only detected in large cluster deployments. It is also used to perform
release soak testing, among other things.

The [repository][bench-repo] contains all the infrastructure and details to get
started with your own load testing.
