# Nomad-Pack: Authoring quick start

Authoring your own pack for simple use cases can be completed in less than five
minutes using the `nomad-pack generate` command.

This guide will walk you through the steps involved in writing your own packs
and pack registries.

## Generate a skeleton registry

First, make a pack registry. This will be a repository that provides the
structure, templates, and metadata that define your custom packs.

Run the `nomad-pack generate registry` command with the `--create-sample-pack`
flag set using the following command.

```shell-session
nomad-pack generate registry tutorial --create-sample-pack
```

### Explore the structure

Each registry should have a README.md file that describes the packs in it, and
top-level directory named `packs` that contains a subdirectory for each individual
pack. Conventionally, the pack subdirectory name matches the pack name.

The top level of a pack registry looks like the following:

```plaintext
.
└── README.md
└── packs
    └── <PACK-NAME-A>
        └── ...pack contents...
    └── <PACK-NAME-B>
        └── ...pack contents...
    └── ...packs...
```


## Step Two: Explore the hello-world pack

## Step Three: Generate your own sample pack

To add a new pack, create a new directory in the `packs` directory of the .

The directory should have the following contents:

- A `README.md` file containing a human-readable description of the pack, often
  including any dependency information.

- A `metadata.hcl` file containing information about the pack.

- A `variables.hcl` file that defines the variables in a pack.

- An optional, but _highly encouraged_ `CHANGELOG.md` file that lists changes
  for each version of the pack.

- An optional `outputs.tpl` file that defines an output to be printed when a
  pack is deployed.

- A `templates` subdirectory containing the HCL templates used to render the
  jobspec.

#### metadata.hcl

The `metadata.hcl` file contains important key value information regarding the pack. It contains the following blocks and their associated fields:

- `app` block

  - `url" - The URL to the homepage of the application to provide a quick
    reference to the documentation and help pages.

- `pack "«name»` a labeled block, where the label is the name of the pack

  - `name` - The name of the pack.

  - `description` - A small overview of the application that is deployed by the
    pack.

  - `version` - The version of the pack.

- `dependency` block. Multiple `dependency` blocks can be supplied

- `name` - The name of a pack that this pack depends on.

- `alias` - When provided, this name will be used instead of the pack's actual
  name

- `source` - The source URL for this dependency.

The following is an example `metadata.hcl` file.

```hcl
app {
  url = "https://github.com/mikenomitch/hello_world_server"
}

pack {
  name = "hello_world"
  description = "This pack contains a single job that renders hello world, or a different greeting, to the screen."
  version = "0.3.2"
}
```

#### variables.hcl

The `variables.hcl` file defines the variables required to fully render and
deploy all the templates found within the "templates" directory.

These variables are defined using [HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl).

The following is an example `variables.hcl` file.

```hcl
variable "datacenters" {
  description = "A list of datacenters in the region which are eligible for task placement."
  type        = list(string)
  default     = ["dc1"]
}

variable "region" {
  description = "The region where the job should be placed."
  type        = string
  default     = "global"
}

variable "app_count" {
  description = "The number of apps to be deployed"
  type        = number
  default     = 3
}

variable "resources" {
  description = "The resource to assign to the application."
  type = object({
    cpu    = number
    memory = number
  })
  default = {
    cpu    = 500,
    memory = 256
  }
}
```

#### outputs.tpl

The `outputs.tpl` is an optional file that defines an output to be printed when
a pack is deployed.

Output files have access to pack variables and template helper functions. The
following is a simple example.

```hcl

Congrats on deploying [[ .nomad_pack.pack.name ]].

There are [[ .hello_world.app_count ]] instances of your job now running on Nomad.
```

#### README.md and CHANGELOG.md

No specific format is required for the `README.md` or `CHANGELOG.md` files.

## Step Four: Edit the Templates

Each file at the top level of the `templates` directory that uses the extension
".nomad.tpl" defines a resource (such as a job) that will be applied to Nomad.
These files can use any UTF-8 encoded prefix as the name.

Helper templates, which can be included within larger templates, have names
prefixed with an underscore “\_” and use a ".tpl" extension. Helper templates
are never rendered to file.

When deploying, Nomad Pack will render each resource template using the
variables provided and apply it to Nomad.

#### Template Basics

Templates are written using [Go Template Syntax](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/nomad/go-template-syntax).
This enables templates to have complex logic where necessary.

Unlike default Go Template syntax, Nomad Pack uses `[[` and `]]` as delimiters.

An example template using variables values from above.

```hcl
job "hello_world" {
  region      = "[[ .hello_world.region ]]"
  datacenters = [ [[ range $idx, $dc := .hello_world.datacenters ]][[if $idx]],[[end]][[ $dc | quote ]][[ end ]] ]
  type = "service"

  group "app" {
    count = [[ .hello_world.count ]]

    network {
      port "http" {
        static = 80
      }
    }

    [[/* this is a go template comment */]]

    task "server" {
      driver = "docker"
      config {
        image = "mikenomitch/hello-world"
        network_mode = "host"
        ports = ["http"]
      }

      resources {
        cpu    = [[ .hello_world.resources.cpu ]]
        memory = [[ .hello_world.resources.memory ]]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This is a relatively simple template that mostly sets variables.

The `datacenters` value shows slightly more complex Go Template, which allows
for [control structures](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/nomad/go-template-syntax#control-structure-list)
like `range` and [pipelines](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/nomad/go-template-syntax#pipelines).

#### Template functions

To supplement the standard Go Template set of template functions, the (masterminds/sprig)[https://github.com/Masterminds/sprig] library is used. This adds helpers for various use cases such as string manipulation, cryptographics, and data conversion (for instance to and from JSON).

Custom Nomad-specific and debugging functions are also provided:

- `nomadRegions` returns the API object from `/v1/regions`.
- `nomadNamespaces` returns the API object from `/v1/namespaces`.
- `nomadNamespace` takes a single string parameter of a namespace ID which will be read via `/v1/namespace/:namespace`.
- `spewDump` dumps the entirety of the passed object as a string. The output includes the content types and values. This uses the `spew.SDump` function.
- `spewPrintf` dumps the supplied arguments into a string according to the supplied format. This utilises the `spew.Printf` function.
- `fileContents` takes an argument to a file of the local host, reads its contents and provides this as a string.

A custom function within a template is called like any other:

```hcl
[[ nomadRegions ]]
[[ nomadRegions | spewDump ]]
```

#### Helper templates

For complex packs, authors may want to reuse template snippets across multiple resources.

For instance, if we had two jobs defined in a pack, and we knew both would re-use the same `region`
logic for both, we could use a helper template to consolidate logic.

Helper template names are prepended with an underscore "\_" and end in ".tpl". So we could define a helper called "\_region.tpl":

```hcl
[[- define "region" -]]
[[- if not (eq .hello_world.region "") -]]
region = [[ .hello_world.region | quote]]
[[- end -]]
[[- end -]]
```

Then in the parent templates, "job_a.nomad.tpl" and "job_b.nomad.tpl", we would render to the helper template using its name:

```hcl
job "job_a" {
  type = "service"

  [[ template "region" . ]]

  ...etc...
}
```

#### Pack Dependencies

Packs can depend on content from other packs.

First, packs must define their dependencies in `metadata.hcl`. A pack block with a dependency would look like the following:

```hcl
app {
  url = "https://some-url-for-the-application.dev"
}

pack {
  name = "simple_service"
  description = "This pack contains a simple service job, and depends on another pack."
  version = "0.2.1"
}

dependency "demo_dep" {
  source = “git://source.git/packs/demo_dep”
}
```

The dependency name label *must* match the `name` property of the dependant pack, as specified in its `metadata.hcl`.

This would allow templates of "simple_service" to use "demo_dep"'s helper templates in the following way:

```shell-session
[[ template "demo_dep.data" . ]]
```

## Step Four: Testing your Pack

As you write your pack, you will probably want to test it. To do this, pass the
directory path as the name of the pack to the `run`, `plan`, `render`, `info`,
`stop`, or `destroy` commands. Relative paths are supported.

For instance, if your current working directory is the directory where you are
developing your pack, and `nomad-pack` is on your path, you can run this command.

```shell-session
nomad-pack run .
```

Packs added this way will show up in output with a `dev` registry and `dev` ref.

## Step Five: Publish and Find your Custom Repository

To use your new pack, you will likely want to publish it to the internet. Push the git repository to a URL
accessible by your command line tool.

If you wish to share your packs, please consider adding them to the
[Nomad Pack Community Registry](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad-pack-community-registry)

If you don't want to host a pack registry in version control, you can work locally
using the filesystem method.

## Step Six: Deploy your Custom Pack

Add your custom repository using the `nomad-pack registry add` command.

```shell-session
nomad-pack registry add my_packs github.com/<YOUR_ORG>/<YOUR_REPO>
```

Deploy your custom packs.

```shell-session
nomad-pack run hello_world --var app_count=1 --registry=my_packs
```

Congrats! You can now write custom packs for Nomad!
