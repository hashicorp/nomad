# Nomad TLS Cert Create

Command: `nomad tls cert create`

The `tls cert create` command is used to create certificates to be used in 
for your Nomad cluster for TLS setup. You can then copy these to your server
as part fo the configurstion. This command will not automatically update the 
settings in the agents.

## Examples

Create a certificate for servers:

```shell-session
$ nomad tls cert create -server
==> WARNING: Server Certificates grants authority to become a
    server and access all state in the cluster including root keys
    and all ACL tokens. Do not distribute them to production hosts
    that are not server nodes. Store them as securely as CA keys.
==> Using CA file nomad-agent-ca.pem and CA key nomad-agent-ca-key.pem
==> Server Certificate saved to global-server-nomad-0.pem
==> Server Certificate key saved to global-server-nomad-0-key.pem
```

Create a certificate for clients:

```shell-session
$ nomad tls cert create -client
==> Using CA file nomad-agent-ca.pem and CA key nomad-agent-ca-key.pem
==> Client Certificate saved to global-client-nomad-0.pem
==> Client Certificate key saved to global-client-nomad-0-key.pem
```

Create a certificate for cli:

```shell-session
$ nomad tls cert create -cli
==> Using CA file nomad-agent-ca.pem and CA key nomad-agent-ca-key.pem
==> Cli Certificate saved to global-cli-nomad-0.pem
==> Cli Certificate key saved to global-cli-nomad-0-key.pem
```
