# Nomad plugins

Plugins extend Nomad's functionality. Review configuration, installation, usage,
and reference information for device and task driver plugins that are not
bundled with Nomad.

Consult the [Plugin authoring guide](/nomad/plugins/author) for details on how
to create your own device, task driver, and host volume plugins.

## Configure plugin directories

@include 'plugins/config-dirs.mdx'
