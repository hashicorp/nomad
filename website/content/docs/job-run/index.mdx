# Run Nomad jobs

This section provides guidance for running Nomad jobs. Inspect job, access logs
for troubleshooting, collect resource utilization metrics, and create job
versions.

The following list is the general flow for operating a job in Nomad:

1. Declare the job according to the [job specification](/nomad/docs/job-specification).
1. Plan and review the changes with a Nomad server.
1. Submit the job file to a Nomad server.
1. (Optional) Review job status and logs.

Refer to [Create and submit a job](/nomad/docs/job-declare/create-job) to learn
how to create a job specification, review the job plan, and submit the job.

## Run a job

Execute the [`nomad job run` command](/nomad/commands/job/run) to run your job.

Now that the job is scheduled, it may or may not be running. You need to inspect
the allocation status and logs to make sure the job started correctly. Refer to
the section on [inspecting state](/nomad/docs/job-run/inspect)
details ways to examine this job's state.

## Update a running job

When updating a job, there are a number of [built-in update
strategies](/nomad/docs/job-declare/strategy) which may be defined in the job
file. The general flow for updating an existing job in Nomad is:

1. Modify the existing job file with the desired changes.
1. Plan and review the changes with a Nomad server.
1. Submit the job file to a Nomad server.
1. (Optional) Review job status and logs.

Because the job specification defines the deployment strategy, the workflow
remains the same regardless of whether this is an initial deployment or a
long-running job.
