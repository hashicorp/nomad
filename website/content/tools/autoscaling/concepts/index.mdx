# Nomad Autoscaler Concepts

This section covers concepts of the Nomad Autoscaler and explains the technical
details of how it functions, its architecture, and sub-systems.

The Nomad Autoscaler is modeled around the concept of a closed-loop control
system. These types of systems are often at the core of self-regulating
mechanisms because they are able to adjust some value based on the current
state of the system and some user provided configuration. An example of a
closed-loop control system is a thermostat, where you set the desired
temperature and the appliance will regulate the output of cold and hot air to
make sure the room stays at the value set.

In closed-loop systems there are a few key components:

* **Setpoint** is the desired output as defined by the user.
* **Comparator** computes the difference between the setpoint and current
  state of the system.
* **Controller** connects all the components together and defines what
  needs to be done to bring the system closer to the desired state.
* **Actuator** applies the changes defined by the controller.
* **System** is the entity being controlled.
* **Output** is the current value of the system.
* **Sensor** reads the system output and translates it to a value that can be
  used by the controller.

The Nomad Autoscaler follows this same base architecture and offloads some of
the components to [different types of plugins](/tools/autoscaling/concepts/plugins).

* The autoscaling **policy** is how users define their desired outcome and
  control the Nomad Autoscaler.
* **Target** is what users want to scale. It can be a job group, where the
  number of allocations is scaled, or a set of Nomad clients, where the number
  of nodes is what changes.
* **Strategy plugins** receive the current status of the scaling target (such
  as the number of allocations of a group) and metrics of the system to compute
  what actions need to be taken.
* **Target plugins** communicate with targets to both read its status and to
  apply changes defined by the Autoscaler.
* **APM plugins** read application performance metrics from external sources.
