# Client HTTP API

The `/client` endpoints are used to interact with the Nomad clients. The API
endpoints are hosted by the Nomad client and requests have to be made to the
Client where the particular allocation was placed.

## Read Stats

This endpoint queries the actual resources consumed on a node. The API endpoint
is hosted by the Nomad client and requests have to be made to the nomad client
whose resource usage metrics are of interest.
