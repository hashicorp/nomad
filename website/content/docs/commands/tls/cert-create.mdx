  Alternative Names. `127.0.0.1` is always included. This flag may be provided
  multiple times.

- `-ca=<string>`: Provide path to the ca. Defaults to `#DOMAIN#-agent-ca.pem`.

- `-cli`: Generate cli certificate.

- `-client`: Generate client certificate.

- `-days=<int>`: Provide number of days the certificate is valid for from now
  on. Defaults to 1 year.

- `-dc=<string>`: Provide the datacenter. Matters only for `-server`
  certificates. Defaults to `dc1`.

- `-domain=<string>`: Provide the domain. Matters only for `-server`

## Examples

Create a certificate for servers:

```shell-session
$ nomad tls cert create -server
==> WARNING: Server Certificates grants authority to become a
    server and access all state in the cluster including root keys
    and all ACL tokens. Do not distribute them to production hosts
    that are not server nodes. Store them as securely as CA keys.
==> Using CA file nomad-agent-ca.pem and CA key nomad-agent-ca-key.pem
==> Server Certificate saved to global-server-nomad.pem
==> Server Certificate key saved to global-server-nomad-key.pem
```

Create a certificate for clients:

```shell-session
$ nomad tls cert create -client
==> Using CA file nomad-agent-ca.pem and CA key nomad-agent-ca-key.pem
==> Client Certificate saved to global-client-nomad.pem
==> Client Certificate key saved to global-client-nomad-key.pem
```

Create a certificate for the CLI:

```shell-session
$ nomad tls cert create -cli
==> Using CA file nomad-agent-ca.pem and CA key nomad-agent-ca-key.pem
==> Cli Certificate saved to global-cli-nomad.pem
==> Cli Certificate key saved to global-cli-nomad-key.pem
```
