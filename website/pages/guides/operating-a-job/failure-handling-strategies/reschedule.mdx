  Nomad can reschedule failing tasks after any local restart attempts have been

  exhausted. This is useful to recover from failures stemming from problems in
  the node

  running the task.

# Reschedule Stanza

Tasks can sometimes fail due to network, CPU or memory issues on the node running the task. In such situations,
Nomad can reschedule the task on another node. The [`reschedule` stanza][reschedule] can be used to configure how
Nomad should try placing failed tasks on another node in the cluster. Reschedule attempts have a delay between
each attempt, and the delay can be configured to increase between each rescheduling attempt according to a configurable
`delay_function`. See the [`reschedule` stanza][reschedule] for more information.

Service jobs are configured by default to have unlimited reschedule attempts. We recommend using the reschedule
stanza to ensure that failed tasks are automatically reattempted on another node without needing operator intervention.

# Example

The following CLI example shows job and allocation statuses for a task being rescheduled by Nomad.
The CLI shows the number of previous attempts if there is a limit on the number of reschedule attempts.
The CLI also shows when the next reschedule will be attempted.

```shell
$nomad job status demo
ID            = demo
Name          = demo
Submit Date   = 2018-04-12T15:48:37-05:00
Type          = service
Priority      = 50
Datacenters   = dc1
Status        = pending
Periodic      = false
Parameterized = false

Summary
Task Group  Queued  Starting  Running  Failed  Complete  Lost
demo        0       0         0        2       0         0
