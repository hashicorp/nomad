description: |-
  The "consul" block allows the group or task to specify that it requires a token
  from a HashiCorp Consul server. Nomad will automatically retrieve a Consul token
  for the group or task.
---

# `consul` Block

<Placement
  groups={[
    ['job', 'group', 'consul'],
    ['job', 'group', 'task', 'consul'],
  ]}
/>

The `consul` block specifies [Consul][] configuration options specific to a
task. If specified at the `group` level, the configuration will apply to all
tasks and services within the group unless a task has its own `consul` block. A
task-level `consul` block will entirely override a group-level `consul` block.

```hcl
job "docs" {
  group "example" {
    task "server" {
      consul {
        cluster   = "default"
        namespace = "default"
        partition = "default"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Workload Identity

Starting in Nomad 1.7, Nomad clients will use a task or service's [Workload
Identity][] to authenticate to Consul and obtain a Consul token specific to the
service or task when the following conditions are met:

* For services, if either the [`consul.service_identity`][] is configured on the
  Nomad servers or the service includes an `identity` block.
* For tasks, if the [`consul.task_identity`][] is configured on the Nomad
  servers, or the task includes an [`identity`][] block with the `name` field
  set to `consul_default` (or `consul_$clusterName` for non-default Consul
  clusters in Nomad Enterprise).

As a fallback if none of these conditions are met, the Nomad client will instead
use, in order of preference:

* The token provided by the [`-consul-token`][flag_consul_token] flag for the
  `nomad job run` command.
* The Consul token as configured in the agent's [`consul.token`][] configuration.
* The Consul token as configured by the agent's `CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN` environment variable.

To avoid failed deployments, you should first set up an authentication method
and binding rules in Consul before configuring the Nomad servers with
`consul.task_identity` and `consul.service_identity`. Refer to [Configuring Consul
Authentication][] for more details.

<Warning>
Starting in Nomad 1.9, the fallback options to use the -consul-token flag when
submitting a job, the agent's consul.token configuration, or the
CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN environment variable, will be removed.  This means service and
template blocks will not be able to use the agent's Consul token or one provided
by the job submitter. You should be prepared to migrate to the Workload Identity
workflow for Consul and Vault before upgrading to Nomad 1.9. Refer to <a
href="/nomad/docs/integrations/consul-integration#migrating-to-using-workload-identity-with-consul">Migrating
to Using Workload Identity with Consul</a>
</Warning>

### Access to Token

The Nomad client will make the Consul token available to the task by writing it
to the secret directory at `secrets/consul_token` and by injecting a
`CONSUL_TOKEN` environment variable in the task. 

If the Nomad cluster is [configured][config_consul_namespace] to use [Consul Namespaces][], a
`CONSUL_NAMESPACE` environment variable will be injected whenever `CONSUL_TOKEN`
is set.

The [`template`][template] block can use the Consul token as well.

### `consul` Parameters

- `cluster` `(string: "default")` <EnterpriseAlert inline/> - Specifies the
  Consul cluster to use. The Nomad client will retrieve a Consul token from the
  cluster configured in the agent configuration with the same
  [`consul.name`][]. In Nomad Community Edition, this field is ignored.

- `namespace` `(string: "")` <EnterpriseAlert inline/> - The Consul namespace in
  which group and task-level services within the group will be registered. Use
  of `template` to access Consul KV will read from the specified Consul
  namespace.  Specifying `namespace` takes precedence over the
  [`-consul-namespace`][flag_consul_namespace] command line argument in `job run`.

- `partition` `(string: "")` - When this field is set, a constraint will be
  added to the group or task to ensure that the allocation is placed on a Nomad
  client that has a Consul Enterprise agent in the specified Consul [admin
  partition][]. Note that Consul Community Edition agents are not assigned to
  any admin partition, so this field should not be used without Consul
  Enterprise.

## `consul` Examples

The following examples only show the `consul` blocks or other relevant
blocks. Remember that the `consul` block is only valid in the placements listed
above.

### Consul Token for Templates

This example tells the Nomad client to obtain a Consul token using the task's
Workload Identity. The token is available to the task via the canonical
environment variable `CONSUL_TOKEN` and written to disk at
`secrets/consul_token`. The `template` block will use the same Consul
token. Note that the `identity.name` is set to `"consul_default"`, which tells
the Nomad client to use this identity when making requests to the default Consul
cluster.

```hcl
job "example" {
  group "app" {
    task "web" {
      identity {
        name = "consul_default"
      }

      template {
        data        = "APP_NAME={{key \"app/name\"}}"
        destination = "local/config.txt"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The following example has the same behavior as the example above, but assumes
that the server has a `consul.task_identity` block configured. Note that both
the `consul` and `identity` blocks can be omitted in this case.

```hcl
job "example" {
  group "app" {
    task "web" {
      template {
        data        = "APP_NAME={{key \"app/name\"}}"
        destination = "local/config.txt"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Consul Token for Group Services

This example tells the Nomad client to obtain a Consul Service Identity token
using the service's Workload Identity. The Consul token will be used to register
the service with Consul and configure any [Connect][] sidecar tasks for that
service.

```hcl
job "example" {
  group "web" {
    service {
      port = "www"
      identity {}
    }
  }
}
```

The following example has the same behavior as the example above, but assumes
that the server has a `consul.service_identity` block configured. Note that both
the `consul` and `identity` blocks can be omitted for the service in this case.

```hcl
job "example" {
  group "web" {
    service {
      port = "www"
    }
  }
}
```

### Consul Namespace

This example shows specifying a particular Consul namespace or Consul cluster
for different tasks within a group.

<EnterpriseAlert />

The `template` block in the `web` task will use the default Consul cluster, and
will obtain a token that allows it access to the `engineering/frontend` Consul
namespace. The `template` block in the `app` task will use the Consul cluster
named `prod-apps`, and will obtain a token that allows it access to the
`engineering/apps` Consul namespace.

```hcl
job "docs" {
  group "example" {

    task "web" {

      consul {
        namespace = "engineering/frontend"
      }

      template {
        data        = "FRONTEND_NAME={{key \"fe/name\"}}"
        destination = "local/config.txt"
      }
    }

    task "app" {

      consul {
        namespace = "engineering/apps"
        cluster   = "prod-apps"
      }

      template {
        data        = "APP_NAME={{key \"app/name\"}}"
        destination = "local/config.txt"
      }
    }

  }
}
```

### Consul Admin Partition

This example demonstrates how to configure Consul admin partitions for different
tasks within a group. The Consul client agent must separately specify the admin
partition in the agent configuration. Refer to the Consul documentation's
[agent configuration reference][] for more information.

<EnterpriseAlert />

In the following example, the `web` and `app` tasks use the default Consul cluster
and obtain a token that allows access to the `prod` admin partition in Consul. The
Consul configuration occurs at the `group` level because tasks are placed together
on the same Allocation. If you configure tasks with separate `consul` blocks, the
`partition` field must be the same in both blocks.

```hcl
job "docs" {
  group "example" {

    consul {
      cluster   = "default"
      namespace = "default"
      partition = "prod"
    }

    task "web" {

      template {
        data        = "FRONTEND_NAME={{key \"fe/name\"}}"
        destination = "local/config.txt"
      }
    }

    task "app" {

      template {
        data        = "APP_NAME={{key \"app/name\"}}"
        destination = "local/config.txt"
      }
    }

  }
}
```
