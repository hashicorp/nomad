## External Plugins

Starting with Nomad 0.9, task and device drivers are now pluggable. This gives
users the flexibility to introduce their own drivers by providing a binary
rather than having to fork Nomad to make code changes to it. See the navigation
menu on the left or the list below for guides on how to use some of the external
drivers available for Nomad.
