# Nomad 1.11.x release notes

We are pleased to announce the following Nomad updates.

## 1.11.0 release highlights

- **Client node identity**. Nomad's client node identity feature uniquely
  identities each Nomad client node and provides an authentication mechanism for
  nodes to make RPC calls to the Nomad servers. Refer to [Node identity](/nomad/docs/architecture/cluster/node-identity) for details.
- **Client node introduction**. Introduce Nomad clients to the cluster with a
  token-based approach. Configure Nomad servers with introduction enforcement
  levels that dictate how clients join the cluster. This approach results in
  logs and metrics to detail introduction violations. Refer to `nomad agent`
  command's [`-client-intro-token`
  parameter](/nomad/commands/agent#client-intro-token) for more information.
- **Job specification secrets block**. Use the new [`secrets`
  block](/nomad/docs/job-specification/secret) to fetch and interpolate secrets
  from a specified location. Nomad automatically retrieves the contents of the
  secret, which you may reference as a variable within the task specification.
  Nomad provides built-in support to fetch secrets from Nomad and Vault.
  Alternately, you may build your own custom secret provider. Refer to the
  [Create a secret provider plugin](/nomad/plugins/author/secret-provider) guide
  for more information.
- **System job deployment**. Jobs of type “system” now support deployment
  functionality. You may now view system job deployment status in the web UI.
