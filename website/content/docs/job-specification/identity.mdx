# `identity` Block

<Placement
  groups={[
    ['job', 'group', 'task', 'identity'],
  ]}
/>

The `identity` block allows a task access to its [Workload Identity][] via an
environment variable or file. By default Nomad will create an identity for all
workloads, but it is *not* exposed to a task.

The following will expose the Workload Identity as an environment variable and
file to the task:

```hcl
job "docs" {
  group "example" {
    task "api" {

      identity {}

      # ...
    }
  }
}
```

The empty block `identity {}` will expose both the environment variable and
file, but either may be individually disabled:

```hcl
job "docs" {
  group "example" {
    task "api" {

      identity {
        env  = true
        file = false
      }

      # ...
    }
  }
}
```

## `identity` Parameters

- `env` `(bool: true)` - If true the workload identity will be available in the
  task's `NOMAD_TOKEN` environment variable.
- `file` `(bool: true)` - If true the workload identity will be available in
  the task's filesystem via the path `secrets/nomad_token`. If the
  [`task.user`][taskuser] parameter is set, the token file will only be
  readable by that user. Otherwise the file is readable by everyone but is
  protected by parent directory permissions.

Note that while both parameters default to `true`, the `identity` block itself
must be present in the job specification or the workload identity will not be
exposed.
