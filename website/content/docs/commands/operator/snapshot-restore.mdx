# Command: operator snapshot restore

Restores an atomic, point-in-time snapshot of the state of the Nomad servers
which includes jobs, nodes, allocations, periodic jobs, and ACLs.

Restores involve a potentially dangerous low-level Raft operation that is not
designed to handle server failures during a restore. This command is primarily
intended to be used when recovering from a disaster, restoring into a fresh
cluster of Nomad servers.

If ACLs are enabled, a management token must be supplied in order to perform
snapshot operations.

To restore a snapshot from the file "backup.snap":

```shell-session
$ nomad operator snapshot restore backup.snap
```

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad operator snapshot restore [options] <file>
```

## General Options

@include 'general_options_no_namespace.mdx'
