# Command: alloc-status

The `alloc-status` command displays status information and metadata about an
existing allocation and its tasks. It can be useful while debugging to reveal
the underlying reasons for scheduling decisions or failures, as well as the
current state of its tasks.

## Usage

```
nomad alloc-status [options] <allocation>
```

An allocation ID or prefix must be provided. If there is an exact match, the
full details of the allocation will be displayed. Otherwise, a list of matching
allocations and information will be displayed.

## General Options

<%= partial "docs/commands/_general_options" %>

## Alloc Status Options

* `-short`: Display short output. Shows only the most recent task event.
* `-verbose`: Show full information.
* `-json` : Output the allocation in its JSON format.
* `-t` : Format and display the allocation using a Go template.

## Examples

Short status of an alloc:

```
$ nomad alloc-status --short 0af996ed
ID                  = 0af996ed
Eval ID             = be9bde98
Name                = example.cache[0]
Node ID             = 43c0b14e
Job ID              = example
Job Version         = 0
Client Status       = running
Client Description  = <none>
Desired Status      = run
Desired Description = <none>
Created At          = 07/25/17 16:12:48 UTC
Deployment ID       = 0c83a3b1
Deployment Health   = healthy

Tasks
Name   State    Last Event  Time
redis  running  Started     07/25/17 16:12:48 UTC
web    running  Started     07/25/17 16:12:49 UTC
```

Full status of an alloc, which shows one of the tasks dying and then being restarted:

```
$ nomad alloc-status 0af996ed
ID                  = 0af996ed
Eval ID             = be9bde98
Name                = example.cache[0]
Node ID             = 43c0b14e
Job ID              = example
Job Version         = 0
Client Status       = running
Client Description  = <none>
Desired Status      = run
Desired Description = <none>
Created At          = 07/25/17 16:12:48 UTC
