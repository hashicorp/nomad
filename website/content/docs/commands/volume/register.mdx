# Command: volume register

The `volume register` command registers external storage volumes with Nomad's
[Container Storage Interface (CSI)][csi] support. The volume must exist on the
remote storage provider before it can be registered and used by a task.

CSI plugins that implement the [Controller][csi_plugins_internals] interface
can be created via the [`volume create`] command, which will automatically
register the volume as well.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad volume register [options] [file]
```

The `volume register` command requires a single argument, specifying the path
to a file containing a valid [volume specification][volume_specification]. This
file will be read and the job will be submitted to Nomad for scheduling. If the
supplied path is "-", the job file is read from STDIN. Otherwise it is read
from the file at the supplied path.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the
`csi-write-volume` capability for the volume's namespace.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

The volume specification is documented in the [Volume
Specification][volume_specification] page.

Not all fields can be updated after the volume is registered:

* The `capacity_min` and `capacity_max` fields can be updated, and may increase
  the volume size if the CSI plugin supports it. Expansion may or may not be
  possible while the volume is in use, again depending on the plugin.
  Reducing volume capacity is not allowed per the CSI spec.
* The `capability` blocks can be added or removed, but only if the capability is
  not currently in use by a mounted volume.
* The `mount_options` block can be updated if the volume is not in use.
* The `secrets` block can be updated.
* The `context` block can be updated. The values for this field are typically
  provided by the CSI plugin, and should not be updated unless recommended by
  the CSI plugin's documentation.
