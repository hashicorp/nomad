# Advanced Scheduling with Nomad

The Nomad [scheduler][scheduling] uses a bin packing algorithm to optimize the resource utilization and density of applications in your Nomad cluster. Nomad 0.9 adds new features to allow operators more fine-grained control over allocation placement. This enables use cases similar to the following:

- Expressing preference for a certain class of nodes for a specific application via the [affinity stanza][affinity-stanza].
- Spreading allocations across a datacenter, rack or any other node attribute or metadata with the [spread stanza][spread-stanza].

Please refer to the guides below for using affinity and spread in Nomad 0.9.
