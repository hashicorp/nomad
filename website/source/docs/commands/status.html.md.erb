# Command: status

The `status` command displays status information for jobs.

## Usage

```
nomad status [options] [job]
```

This command accepts an optional job ID or prefix as the sole argument. If there
is an exact match based on the provided job ID or prefix, then information about
the specific job is queried and displayed. Otherwise, a list of matching jobs and
information will be displayed.

If the ID is omitted, the command lists out all of the existing jobs and a few of
the most useful status fields for each.

## General Options

<%= general_options_usage %>

## Status Options

* `-evals`: Display the evaluations associated with the job.

* `-short`: Display short output. Used only when a single node is being queried.
  Drops verbose node allocation data from the output.

* `-verbose`: Show full information.

## Examples

List of all jobs:

```
$ nomad status

job3   service  2         pending
job4   service  1         complete
```

Full status information showing evaluations with a placement failure. The in
progress evaluation denotes that Nomad is blocked waiting for resources to
become availables so that it can place the remaining allocations.
