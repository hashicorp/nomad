# Command: job start

The `job start` command is used to start a stopped job.
Use the `nomad job start` command to start the latest version of an existing job
with a status of Stopped.

If your Nomad servers use [consul service identity] authentication and your job
uses Consul Connect services, you must supply a Consul token. Nomad does not
persist the Consul token when you [run] a job. Use the `-consul-token` flag to
pass the token to the `nomad job start` command. Alternately, you may use the
`$CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN` environment variable.

If your Nomad servers require [Vault policy] authentication, you must supply a
Vault token. Nomad does not persist the Vault token when you [run] a job.
Use the `-vault-token` flag to pass the token to the `nomad job start` command.
Alternately, you may use the `$VAULT_TOKEN` environment variable.

## Usage

```shell-session
nomad job start [options] <job_id>
```

The `nomad job start` command requires the job ID. Nomad starts the latest
version of the job. This command fails if the job does is not currently stopped.

When Nomad uses ACLs, the `nomad job start` command requires a token with one of
the following capabilities based on the specific scenario:

- The `submit-job`capability for the job's namespace
- The `list-jobs` capability to run the command with a job prefix instead of the
  exact job ID
- The `read-job` capability is required to monitor the resulting evaluation when
  you do not use the `-detach`option.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Start Options

- `-detach`: Return immediately instead of monitoring. Nomad outputs a new
  evaluation ID, which you can use to examine the evaluation using the
  [eval status] command.

- `-consul-token`: If set, Nomad sends the Consul token with the
  request. This overrides the token found in the `$CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN`
  environment variable.

- `-vault-token`: If set, Nomad includes the Vault token with the request. This
  overrides the token found in the `$VAULT_TOKEN` environment variable.

- `-verbose`: Show full information.

## Examples

Start a previously stopped job.

```shell-session
$ nomad job status
ID       Type     Priority  Status          Submit Date
example  service  50        dead (stopped)  2025-02-11T15:33:27-05:00
