# nomad-pack registry delete command reference

Use the `nomad-pack registry delete` command to delete registries or packs from the local environment.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad-pack registry delete <name> [options]
```

## Options

- `-target=<string>`: A specific pack within the registry. If you add a
  reference flag, the command only deletes that reference of the target pack.
- `-ref=<string>`: Specific Git reference of the registry or pack. Supports
  tags, SHA, and `@latest`. If you do not specify a reference, the command defaults to `@latest`. Using `ref` with a file path is not supported.

<Warning>

If you do not specify `target` or `ref`, this command deletes the entire
specified registry.

</Warning>

## Examples

Delete the Traefik pack with tag `v0.0.1` from your local `community` registry.

```shell
nomad-pack registry delete community --target=traefik --ref=v0.0.1
```

Delete the `community` registry from the local environment.

```shell
nomad-pack registry delete community
```
