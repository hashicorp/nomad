> Nomad product documentation no longer publishes from the `/website` directory.

The Nomad docs now live in the
[`hashicorp/web-unified-docs`](https://github.com/hashicorp/web-unified-docs)
repo under `/content/nomad/`.

You can still contribute to Nomad docs by created a PR under
`hashicorp/web-unified-docs`:

- For content changes related to a release, submit PRs against
  the upcoming release branch.

- For version-agnostic updates like typos, corrections, and broken links, submit
  PRs against the `main` branch.

[`web-unified-docs` CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/hashicorp/web-unified-docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

The internal [`team-nomad` docs wiki page](https://github.com/hashicorp/team-nomad/blob/main/wiki/docs.md) contains
additional workflows and details specific to Nomad docs creation and maintenance.
