# Nomad 1.11.x release notes

We are pleased to announce the following Nomad updates.

## 1.11.0 release highlights

- **Client node identity**. Nomad's client node identity feature uniquely
  identities each Nomad client node and provides an authentication mechanism for
  nodes to make RPC calls to the Nomad servers. Refer to [Node identity](/docs/architecture/cluster/node-identity) for details.
- **Client node introduction**. Introduce Nomad clients to the cluster with a
  token-based approach. Configure Nomad servers with introduction enforcement
  levels that dictate how clients join the cluster. This approach results in logs and metrics to detail introduction violations.
- **Job specification secrets block**. Job Specification Secrets Block: A new
  job specification block allows for fetching and interpolating secrets within
  the specification.
- **System job deployment**. System Job Deployments: Job of type “system” now support deployment functionality.

### Improvements

- api: The `Evaluations.Info` method of the Go API now populates the `RelatedEvals` field. [[GH-26156](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/26156)]
- build: Add tzdata to Docker container final image [[GH-26794](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/26794)]
- build: Updated Go to 1.25.1 [[GH-26823](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/26823)]
- cli: Add -preserve-resources flag for keeping resource block when updating jobs [[GH-26841](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/26841)]
- cli: Added related evals and placed allocations tables to the eval status command, and exposed more fields without requiring the `-verbose` flag. [[GH-26156](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/26156)]
- config: Added job_max_count option to limit number of allocs for a single job [[GH-26858](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/26858)]
- consul connect: Allow cni/- network mode; use at your own risk [[GH-26449](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/26449)]
- install (Enterprise): Updated license information displayed during post-install [[GH-26791](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/26791)]
- metrics: Reduce memory usage on the Nomad leader for collecting eval broker metrics. [[GH-26737](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/26737)]
- scheduler: Add reconciler annotations to the output of the `eval status` command [[GH-26188](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/26188)]
- scheduler: Debug-level logs emitted by the scheduler are now single-line structured logs [[GH-26169](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/26169)]
- scheduler: For service and batch jobs, the scheduler no longer includes stops for already-stopped canaries in plans it submits. [[GH-26292](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/26292)]
- scheduler: For service and batch jobs, the scheduler treats a group.count=0 identically to removing the task group from the job, and will stop all non-terminal allocations. [[GH-26292](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/26292)]

### Breaking changes

- metrics: Eval broker metrics that previously used the job ID as a label now use the parent ID of dispatch and periodic jobs [[GH-26737](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/26737)]
- sysbatch: Submitting a sysbatch job with a `reschedule` block now returns an error instead of being silently ignored [[GH-26279](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/26279)]
