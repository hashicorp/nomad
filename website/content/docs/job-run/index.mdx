# Run Nomad jobs

This section provides guidance for running Nomad jobs. Inspect job, access logs
for troubleshooting, collect resource utilization metrics, and create job
versions.

The following list is the general flow for operating a job in Nomad:

1. Declare the job according to the [job specification](/nomad/docs/job-specification).
1. Plan and review the changes with a Nomad server.
1. Submit the job file to a Nomad server.
1. (Optional) Review job status and logs.

Refer to [Create and submit a job](/nomad/docs/job-declare/create-job) to learn
how to create a job specification, review the job plan, and submit the job.

## Run a job

Execute the [`nomad job run` command](/nomad/commands/job/run) to run your job.

Now that the job is scheduled, it may or may not be running. You need to inspect
the allocation status and logs to make sure the job started correctly. Refer to
the section on [inspecting state](/nomad/docs/job-run/inspect)
details ways to examine this job's state.

## Update a running job

When updating a job, there are a number of [built-in update
strategies](/nomad/docs/job-declare/strategy) which may be defined in the job
file. The general flow for updating an existing job in Nomad is:

1. Modify the existing job file with the desired changes.
1. Plan and review the changes with a Nomad server.
1. Submit the job file to a Nomad server.
1. (Optional) Review job status and logs.

Because the job specification defines the deployment strategy, the workflow
remains the same regardless of whether this is an initial deployment or a
long-running job.

## Run a job in the web UI

1. From the **Jobs** page in the web UI, click on the **Run Job** button in the
top right of the page. 
1. Enter the job definition in HCL into the **Job Definition** field, upload
a jobspec file with the **Upload file** button, or choose from a set of
templated jobspecs with the **Choose from template** button.
1. Click on the **Plan** button at the bottom of the page. Nomad plans the job
and displays the scheduler dry-run results.
1. Click on the **Run** button at the bottom of the page.

## View a running job in the web UI

Nomad serves the web UI alongside the API. You can open the web UI in a web
browser with the [`nomad ui` command](/nomad/commands/ui) or you can use the
cluster address and navigate to the `/ui` path.

```shell-session
$ nomad ui
Opening URL "https://127.0.0.1:4646"
```

When accessing the web UI, the first page you see is a listing of all the jobs
for the default namespace. Clicking on a job takes you to the Job details page.

### View a job from the CLI

You can open the details page for a job by providing the job name to the
`nomad ui` command.

```shell-session
$ nomad ui example-job-name
Opening URL "https://127.0.0.1:4646/ui/jobs/example-job-name"
```

### View an allocation from the CLI

You can open the details page for an allocation by providing the allocation ID
to the `nomad ui` command.

```shell-session
$ nomad ui 7dc9f2d6
Opening URL "https://127.0.0.1:4646/ui/allocations/7dc9f2d6-15fc-7c39-4692-70fe653d960e"
```
