# Workload Identity

When an [allocation][] is accepted by the [plan applier][], the leader generates
a Workload Identity for each task in the allocation. This workload identity is a
[JSON Web Token (JWT)][] that has been signed by the leader's keyring. The
workload identity includes the following identity claims:

```json
{
  "nomad_namespace": "default",
  "nomad_job_id": "example",
  "nomad_allocation_id": "5c6328f7-48c5-4d03-bada-91ef2e904d0d",
  "nomad_task": "web"
}
```

## Implicit Access to ACL Policies

Nomad automatically attaches a set of implicit ACL policies to every workload
identity. The names of these policies start with the Nomad-owned prefix `_:`,
followed by the namespace, job ID, task group name, and task name.

```
_:/$namespace/$job_id/$task_group/$task
_:/$namespace/$job_id/$task_group
_:/$namespace/$job_id
_:/$namespace
```

For example, a task named "redis", in a group named "cache", in a job named
"example", will automatically have the following policies:

```
_:/default/example/cache/redis
_:/default/example/cache
_:/default/example
_:/default
```

If these policies do not exist, the workload identity does not have any
additional capabilities. But you can create a policy with one of these names and
the task will automatically have access to them. For example, to give the task
above access to set of shared secrets, you can create the following policy file:

```hcl
namespace "shared" {
  secure_variables {
    path "*" {
      capabilities = ["read"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then create the policy to give the task read access to
all paths in the "shared" namespace:

```shell-session
nomad acl policy apply "_:/default/example/cache/redis" ./policy.hcl
```

## Using Workload Identity

In Nomad 1.4.0 the workload identity is used only for `template`
access to [Secure Variables][] and not exposed outside of Nomad.
