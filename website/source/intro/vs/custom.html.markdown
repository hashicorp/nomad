# Nomad vs. Custom Solutions

It is an undisputed fact that distributed systems are hard; building
one is error-prone and time-consuming. As a result, few organizations
build a scheduler due to the inherent challenges. However,
most organizations must develop a means of deploying applications
and typically this evolves into an ad hoc deployment platform.

These deployment platforms are typically special cased to the needs
of the organization at the time of development, reduce future agility,
and require time and resources to build and maintain

Nomad provides a high-level job specification to easily deploy applications.
It has been designed to work at large scale, with multi-datacenter and
multi-region support built in. Nomad also has extensible drivers giving it
flexibility in the workloads it supports, including Docker.

Nomad provides organizations of any size a solution for deployment
that is simple, robust, and scalable. It reduces the time and effort spent
re-inventing the wheel and users can focus instead on their business applications.
