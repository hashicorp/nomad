# Community Supported

If you have authored a task driver plugin that you believe will be useful to the
broader Nomad community and you are committed to maintaining the plugin, please
file a PR to add your plugin to this page.

For details on authoring a task driver plugin, please refer to the [plugin
authoring guide][plugin_guide].

## Task Driver Plugins

Nomad has a plugin system for defining task drivers. External task driver
plugins will have the same user experience as built in drivers.

Below is a list of community-supported task drivers you can use with Nomad:

- [containerd][nomad-driver-containerd]
- [Firecracker][firecracker-task-driver]
- [Jail task driver][jail-task-driver]
- [Lightrun][lightrun]
- [LXC][lxc]
- [Pot][pot]
- [Rkt][rkt]
- [Rookout][rookout]
- [Singularity][singularity]
- [systemd-nspawn][nspawn-driver]
- [Windows IIS][nomad-driver-iis]
