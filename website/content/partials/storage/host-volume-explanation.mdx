Host volumes mount paths from the Nomad client into allocations.
Nomad is aware of host volume availability and makes use of it for job
scheduling. However, Nomad does not know about the volume's underlying
characteristics, such as if it is a standard folder on a local ext4 filesystem,
if it is backed by a distributed networked storage such as GlusterFS, or if it is a mounted
NFS/CIFS volume from a NAS or a public cloud service such as AWS EFS. Therefore,
you can use host volumes for both local semi-persistent storage and for
highly persistent networked storage. Host volumes may be _dynamic_ or _static_.

Host volumes backed by local storage help persist data that is neither critical nor
readily restorable. Examples include an on-disk cache that can be rebuilt, or a
clustered application where a single node can rebuild its state from the rest of
the cluster. When backed by networked storage such as NFS/CIFS-mounted volumes
or distributed storage with GlusterFS or Ceph, host volumes provide a quick
option to consume highly available and reliable storage.

#### Dynamic host volumes

Provision dynamic host volumes
with the [`volume create`](/nomad/commands/volume/create) command or
API. [ACL policies](/nomad/docs/other-specifications/acl-policy#namespace-rules)
allow delegation of control for storage within a namespace to Nomad
Operators. The [dynamic host volume plugin
specification](/nomad/plugins/author/host-volume) allows you to
develop plugins specific to your local storage environment. For example, in an
on-prem cluster you could write a plugin to perform LVM thin-provisioning.

#### Static host volumes

Declare static host volumes in the Nomad agent's configuration file. You
must restart the Nomad client to reconfigure them. These restarts make static host
volumes impractical if you frequently change your storage configuration.
Furthermore, it might require coordination between different
[personas](/nomad/docs/architecture/security#personas) to configure and consume
host volumes. For example, a Nomad Administrator must modify Nomad's
configuration file to add, update, and remove host volumes to make them
available for consumption by Nomad Operators. Or, with networked host volumes, a
Storage Administrator needs to provision the volumes and makes them available to
the Nomad clients. A System Administrator then mounts them on the Nomad clients.
