# `upstreams` Stanza

The `upstreams` stanza allows configuring various options for managing upstream
services that a [Consul
Connect](/docs/integrations/consul-connect) proxy routes to. It
is valid only within the context of a `proxy` stanza.

For Consul-specific details see the [Consul Connect
Guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/consul/getting-started/connect#register-a-dependent-service-and-proxy).

```hcl
job "countdash" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]

  group "dashboard" {
    network {
      mode = "bridge"

      port "http" {
        static = 9002
        to     = 9002
      }
    }

    service {
      name = "count-dashboard"
      port = "9002"

      connect {
        sidecar_service {
          proxy {
            upstreams {
              destination_name = "count-api"
              local_bind_port  = 8080
              datacenter = "dc2"
              local_bind_address = "127.0.0.1"
              mesh_gateway {
                mode = "local"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

    task "dashboard" {
      driver = "docker"

      env {
        COUNTING_SERVICE_URL = "http://${NOMAD_UPSTREAM_ADDR_count_api}"
      }

      config {
        image = "hashicorpnomad/counter-dashboard:v3"
      }
    }
  }
}

```

## `upstreams` Parameters

- `destination_name` `(string: <required>)` - Name of the upstream service.
- `local_bind_port` - `(int: <required>)` - The port the proxy will receive
  connections for the upstream on.
- `datacenter` `(string: "")` - The Consul datacenter in which to issue the
  discovery query. Defaults to the empty string, which Consul interprets as the
  local Consul datacenter.
- `local_bind_address` - `(string: "")` - The address the proxy will receive
  connections for the upstream on.
- `mesh_gateway` <code>([mesh_gateway][mesh_gateway_param]: nil)</code> - Configures the mesh gateway
  behavior for connecting to this upstream.

### `mesh_gateway` Parameters

- `mode` `(string: "")` - The mode of operation in which to use [Connect Mesh Gateways][mesh_gateways].
  If left unset, the mode will default to the mode as determined by the Consul [service-defaults][service_defaults_mode]
  configuration for the service. Can be configured with the following modes:
  - `local` - In this mode the Connect proxy makes its outbound connection to a
  gateway running in the same datacenter. That gateway is then responsible for
  ensuring the data gets forwarded along to gateways in the destination datacenter.
  - `remote` - In this mode the Connect proxy makes its outbound connection to a
  gateway running in the destination datacenter. That gateway will then forward
  the data to the final destination service.
  - `none` - In this mode, no gateway is used and a Connect proxy makes its
  outbound connections directly to the destination services.

The `NOMAD_UPSTREAM_ADDR_<destination_name>` environment variables may be used
to interpolate the upstream's `host:port` address.

Applications are encouraged to connect to `127.0.0.1` and a well defined port
(eg 6379 for Redis) by default. Then when using Consul Connect the application
can be deployed with the Redis upstream's `local_bind_port = 6379` and require
no explicit configuration.

## `upstreams` Examples

The following example is an upstream config with the name of the destination service
and a local bind port.

```hcl
    upstreams {
      destination_name = "count-api"
      local_bind_port = 8080
    }
```
