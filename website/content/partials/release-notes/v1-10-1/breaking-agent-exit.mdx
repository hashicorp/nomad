#### Agent exit on reloading configuration errors

Errors encountered when reloading agent configuration now cause agents to exit.
In prior versions, Nomad only logged configuration errors during reloads. This
could lead to agents running but unable to communicate. Any other errors when
parsing the new configuration are logged and the reload is aborted, consistent
with the current behavior.
