# Command: volume register

The `volume register` command registers external storage volumes with Nomad's
[Container Storage Interface (CSI)][csi] support. The volume must exist on the
remote storage provider before it can be registered and used by a task.

CSI plugins that implement the [Controller][csi_plugins_internals] interface
can be created via the [`volume create`] command, which will automatically
register the volume as well.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad volume register [options] [file]
```

The `volume register` command requires a single argument, specifying the path
to a file containing a valid [volume
specification][volume_specification]. This file will be read and the job will
be submitted to Nomad for scheduling. If the supplied path is "-", the job
file is read from STDIN. Otherwise it is read from the file at the supplied
path.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the
`csi-write-volume` capability for the volume's namespace.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Volume Specification

The file may be provided as either HCL or JSON. An example HCL configuration:

```hcl
id              = "ebs_prod_db1"
name            = "database"
type            = "csi"
external_id     = "vol-23452345"
plugin_id       = "ebs-prod"

secrets {
  example_secret = "xyzzy"
}

parameters {
  skuname = "Premium_LRS"
}

context {
  endpoint = "http://192.168.1.101:9425"
}
```

## Volume Specification Parameters

- `id` `(string: <required>)` - The unique ID of the volume. This is how the
  [`volume.source`][csi_volume_source] field in a job specification will refer
  to the volume.

- `name` `(string: <required>)` - The display name of the volume.

- `type` `(string: <required>)` - The type of volume. Currently only `"csi"`
  is supported.

- `external_id` `(string: <required>)` - The ID of the physical volume from
  the storage provider. For example, the volume ID of an AWS EBS volume or
  Digital Ocean volume.

- `plugin_id` `(string: <required>)` - The ID of the [CSI plugin][csi_plugin]
  that manages this volume.

- `capability` `(Capability: <required>)` - Option for validating the
  capability of a volume. You must provide at least one `capability` block, and
  you must provide a block for each capability you intend to use in a job's
  [`volume`] block. Each `capability` block must have the following fields:

  - `access_mode` `(string: <required>)` - Defines whether a volume should be
    available concurrently. Can be one of `"single-node-reader-only"`,
    `"single-node-writer"`, `"multi-node-reader-only"`,
    `"multi-node-single-writer"`, or `"multi-node-multi-writer"`. Most CSI
    plugins support only single-node modes. Consult the documentation of the
    storage provider and CSI plugin.

  - `attachment_mode` `(string: <required>)` - The storage API that will be used
    by the volume. Most storage providers will support `"file-system"`, to mount
    volumes using the CSI filesystem API. Some storage providers will support
    `"block-device"`, which will mount the volume with the CSI block device API
    within the container.

- `secrets` <code>(map<string|string>:nil)</code> - An optional
  key-value map of strings used as credentials for publishing and
  unpublishing volumes.

- `parameters` <code>(map<string|string>:nil)</code> - An optional
  key-value map of strings passed directly to the CSI plugin to
  configure the volume. The details of these parameters are specific
  to each storage provider, so please see the specific plugin
  documentation for more information.

- `context` <code>(map<string|string>:nil)</code> - An optional
  key-value map of strings passed directly to the CSI plugin to
  validate the volume. The details of these parameters are specific to
  each storage provider, so please see the specific plugin
  documentation for more information.

### Unused Fields

Note that several fields used in the [`volume create`] command are set
automatically by the plugin when `volume create` is successful and cannot be
set on a pre-existing volume. You should not set the `snapshot_id`,
`clone_id`, `capacity_min`, or `capacity_max` fields described on that page.
