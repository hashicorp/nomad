# Service discovery

Service discovery is the process of retrieving the low-level information
necessary to access a service, such as its IP and port, via a high-level
identifier, such as a human-friendly service name.

The service information is stored in a service catalog which provide interfaces
that can be used to query data. In Nomad there are two service catalogs:

- The **native service discovery** catalog is embedded in Nomad and requires no
  additional infrastructure.

- The [**Consul service discovery catalog**][consul_sd] requires access to a
  Consul cluster, but it provides additional features, including a [DNS
  interface][consul_dns] and [service mesh][] capabilities.

Services are registered using the [`service`][] block, with the [`provider`][]
parameter defining which catalog to use. Nomad stores the IP and port of all
allocations associated with the service in the catalog and keeps these entries
updated as you schedule new workloads or deploy new versions of your
applications.

```hcl
job "..." {
  # ...
  group "..." {
    service {
      name     = "database"
      port     = "db"
      provider = "nomad"
      # ...
    }
    # ...
  }
}
```

To access services, other allocations can query the catalog using
[`template`][] blocks with the [`service`][ct_service_fn] function to query the
Consul catalog or the [`nomadService`][ct_nomad_service_fn] function when using
Nomad native service discovery. The `template` can then be used as a
configuration file or have its content loaded as environment variables to
configure connection information in applications.

```hcl
job "..." {
  # ...
  group "..." {
    task "..." {
      template {
        data = <<EOF
{{ range nomadService "database" }}
DB_CONNECTION="host={{ .Address }} port={{ .Port }} user=user password=password dbname=db_name"
{{ end }}
EOF
        destination = "local/env.txt"
        env         = true
      }
    }
    # ...
  }
}
```

## Health checks

Both Nomad and Consul services can define health checks to make sure that only
healthy instances are returned by the service catalog. Health checks are
specified using the [`check`][] block.

## Service tags

`service` blocks may be specified multiple times with the same name but for
different ports. All instances are returned when the service name is queried.
To restrict results you can assign [`tags`][] to services to group them. When
querying the service you can provide tag values as part of the service name.

The example below exposes an application on two ports for different protocols.

```hcl
job "..." {
  # ...
  group "..." {
    network {
      port "http" {}
      port "grpc" {}
    }

    service {
      name = "my-app"
      port = "http"
      tags = ["http"]
      # ...
    }

    service {
      name = "my-app"
      port = "grpc"
      tags = ["grpc"]
      # ...
    }
  }
}
```

By assigning different `tags` the port for each protocol can be reached using
the `http.my-app` and `grpc.my-app` service queries.

### Canary deployments

When using [canary][jobspec_update_canary] or
[blue/green][jobspec_update_blue_green] upgrades you can specify a different
set of tags for the canary allocations using the [`canary_tags`][]
configuration.

During a deployment, the new allocations are registered with the tags set in
`canary_tags` while non-canaries have the values in `tags`. Having different
sets of tags allow you to create separate [load balancing][learn_lb] routing
rules to preview canaries.

-> **Note**: Services are registered with either `tags` or `canary_tags`. In
  order to share values they must be set in both fields.
