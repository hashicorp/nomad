```release-note:breaking-change
device/nvidia: The Nvidia device plugin is no longer packaged with Nomad and is instead distributed separately. Further, the Nvidia device plugin codebase is now in a separate [repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad-device-nvidia). If you are using Nvidia devices, please follow the 1.2.0 upgrade guide as you will have to install the Nvidia device plugin before conducting an in-place upgrade to Nomad 1.2.0
```
