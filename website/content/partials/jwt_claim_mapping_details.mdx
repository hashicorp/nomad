## Trusted Identity Attributes via Claim Mappings

The authentication step can return data from JWT claims as trusted
identity attributes for use in binding rule selectors and bind name
interpolation.

The `ClaimMappings` and `ListClaimMappings` attributes control how Nomad maps claims
to identity attributes. Both are maps of items to copy,
with elements of the form `"<JWT claim>":"<attribute suffix>"`.

Use `ClaimMappings` to map singular values and `ListClaimMappings` to map lists of values.

Nomad can interpolate the singular values mapped by `ClaimMappings` in a binding
rule, but Nomad cannot interpolate the lists of values mapped by `ListClaimMappings`.

This examples contains `ClaimMappings` and `ListClaimMappings`. The configuration
instructs Nomad to copy the values in the JWT claims `"givenName"` and `"surname"`
to attributes named `"value.first_name"` and `"value.last_name"` respectively.
Additionally, Nomad should copy the list of values in the JWT
claim `"groups"`  to an attribute named `"list.groups"`.

```json
{
  "Name": "example-auth-method",
  "Type": "<jwt|oidc>",
  "Description": "Example auth method",
  "Config": {
    "ClaimMappings": {
      "givenName": "first_name",
      "surname": "last_name"
    },
    "ListClaimMappings": {
      "groups": "groups"
    }
  }
}
```

The following table shows the resulting attributes and
the ways they may be used in rule bindings:

| Attributes         | Supported selector operations                      | Can be interpolated |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `value.first_name` | Equal, Not Equal, In, Not In, Matches, Not Matches | yes                 |
| `value.last_name`  | Equal, Not Equal, In, Not In, Matches, Not Matches | yes                 |
| `list.groups`      | In, Not In, Is Empty, Is Not Empty                 | no                  |

### Claim Specifications and JSON Pointer

Use the `ClaimMappings` and `ListClaimMappings` fields to point to data
within the JWT. If the desired key is at the top of level of the JWT, you may
provide the name directly. If it is nested at a lower level, you may use a JSON
Pointer.

This example shows decoded JWT claims.

```json
{
  "division": "North America",
  "groups": {
    "primary": "Engineering",
    "secondary": "Software"
  },
  "iss": "https://my-corp-app-name.auth0.com/",
  "sub": "auth0|eiw7OWoh5ieSh7ieyahC3ief0uyuraphaengae9d",
  "aud": "V1RPi2MYptMV1RPi2MYptMV1RPi2MYpt",
  "iat": 1589224148,
  "exp": 1589260148,
  "nonce": "eKiihooH3Fah8Ieshah4leeti6ien3"
}
```

Use the following syntax to reference data:

- Top-level key: Use direct reference. For example, `"division"` refers to `"North America"`.
- Nested key: Use JSON Pointer syntax. For example, `"/groups/primary"` refers to `"Engineering"`.

You may use any valid JSON Pointer as a selector. Refer to the [JSON Pointer
RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) for a full description of the syntax.
