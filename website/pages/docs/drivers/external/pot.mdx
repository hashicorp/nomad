# Pot Task Driver

Name: `pot`

The Pot task driver provides an interface for using [pot][pot-github-repo] for dynamically running applications inside a FreeBSD Jail.
You can download the external nomad-pot-driver [here][nomad-pot-driver].

## Task Configuration

```hcl
task "nginx-pot" {
    driver = "pot"

    config {
      image = "https://pot-registry.zapto.org/registry/"
      pot = "FBSD120-nginx"
      tag = "1.0"
      command = "nginx"
      args = [
        "-g 'daemon off;'"
      ]
      network_mode = "public-bridge"
      port_map = {
        http = "80"
      }
      copy = [
        "/root/index.html:/usr/local/www/nginx-dist/index.html",
        "/root/nginx.conf:/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf"
      ]
      mount = [
        "/tmp/test:/root/test",
      ]
      mount_read_only = [
        "/tmp/test2:/root/test2"
      ]
      extra_hosts = [
        "artifactory.yourdomain.com:192.168.0.1",
        "mail.yourdomain.com:192.168.0.2"
      ]
   }
}
```

The pot task driver supports the following parameters:

- `image` - The url for the http registry from where to get the image.

- `pot` - Name of the image in the registry.

- `tag` - Version of the image.

- `command` - Command that is going to be executed once the jail is started.

- `args` - (Optional) List of options for the command executed on the command argument.

- `network_mode` - (Optional) Defines the network mode of the pot. Default: **"public-bridge"**

  Possible values are:

  **"public-bridge"** pot creates an internal virtual network with a NAT table where all traffic is going to be sent.

  **"host"** pot bounds the jail directly to a host port.

- `port_map` - (Optional) Sets the port on which the application is listening inside of the jail. If not set, the application will inherit the port configuration from the image.

- `copy` - (Optional) Copies a file from the host machine to the pot jail in the given directory.

- `mount` - (Optional) Mounts a read/write folder from the host machine to the pot jail.

- `mount_read_only` - (Optional) Mounts a read only directory inside the pot jail.

- `extra_hosts` - (Optional) A list of hosts, given as host:IP, to be added to /etc/hosts

## Client Requirements

`pot Task Driver` requires the following:

- 64-bit FreeBSD 12.0-RELEASE host .
- The FreeBSD's Nomad binary (available as a package).
- The pot-task-driver binary placed in the [plugin_dir][plugin_dir] directory.
- Installing [pot][pot-github-repo] and following the install [guide][pot-install-guide].
- Webserver from where to serve the images. (simple file server)
- Following lines need to be included in your rc.conf
