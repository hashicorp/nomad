# Federate multi-region clusters

Nomad operates at a regional level and provides first-class support for
federation. Federation enables users to submit jobs or interact with the HTTP
API targeting any region, from any server, even if that server resides in a
different region.

Federating multiple Nomad clusters requires network connectivity between the
clusters. Servers in each cluster must be able to communicate over [RPC and
Serf][ports-used]. Federated clusters are expected to communicate over WANs, so
they do not need the same low latency as servers within a region.

Once Nomad servers are able to connect over the network, you can issue the
[nomad server join][server-join] command from any server in one region to a
server in a remote region to federate the clusters.

## Prerequisites

To perform the tasks described in this guide, you need to have two Nomad
environments with ports 4646, 4647, and 4648 exposed. You can use this
[Terraform environment][nomad-tf] to provision the sandbox environments. This
guide assumes two clusters with one server node and two client nodes in each
cluster. While the Terraform code already opens port 4646, you will also need to
expose ports 4647 and 4648 on the server you wish to run [nomad server
join][server-join] against (consult the [Nomad Port Requirements][ports-used]
documentation for more information).

<Note>

 This tutorial is for demo purposes and only assumes a single server
node in each cluster. Consult the [reference architecture][reference-arch] for
production configuration.

</Note>

## Verify current regions

Currently, each of your clusters is in the default `global`
[region][region-config]. You can verify this by running [nomad server
members][nomad-server-members] on any node in each of your clusters:

```shell-session
$ nomad server members
Name                    Address       Port  Status  Leader  Protocol  Build   Datacenter  Region
ip-172-31-29-34.global  172.31.29.34  4648  alive   true    2         0.10.1  dc1         global
```

## Change the regions

Respectively change the region of your individual clusters into `west` and
`east` by adding the [region][region-config] parameter into the agent
configuration on the servers and clients (if you are using the provided sandbox
environment, this configuration is located at `/etc/nomad.d/nomad.hcl`).

Below is a snippet of the configuration file showing the required change on a
node for one of the clusters (remember to change this value to `east` on the
servers and clients in your other cluster):

```hcl
data_dir = "/opt/nomad/data"
bind_addr = "0.0.0.0"
region = "west"
# ...
```

Once you have made the necessary changes for each cluster, restart the nomad
service on each node:

```shell-session
$ sudo systemctl restart nomad
```

Re-run the `nomad server members` command on any node in the cluster to verify
that your server is configured to be the in the correct region. The output below
is from running the command in the `west` region (make sure to run this command
in your other cluster to make sure it is in the `east` region):

```shell-session
$ nomad server members
Name                  Address       Port  Status  Leader  Protocol  Build   Datacenter  Region
ip-172-31-29-34.west  172.31.29.34  4648  alive   true    2         0.10.1  dc1         west
```

## Federate the regions

Run the [`nomad server join`][server-join] command from a server in one cluster
and supply it the IP address of the server in your other cluster while
specifying port 4648.

Below is an example of running the `nomad server join` command from the server
in the `west` region while targeting the server in the `east` region:

```shell-session
$ nomad server join 172.31.26.138:4648
Joined 1 servers successfully
```

## Verify the clusters have been federated

After you have federated your clusters, the output from the `nomad server members` command will show the servers from both regions:

```shell-session
$ nomad server members
Name                     Address        Port  Status  Leader  Protocol  Build   Datacenter  Region
ip-172-31-26-138.east    172.31.26.138  4648  alive   true    2         0.10.1  dc1         east
ip-172-31-29-34.west     172.31.29.34   4648  alive   true    2         0.10.1  dc1         west
```

## Check job status in remote cluster

From the Nomad cluster in the `west` region, try to run the [`nomad status`][nomad-status] command to check the status of jobs in the `east` region:

```shell-session
$ nomad status -region="east"
No running jobs
```

If your regions were not federated properly, you will receive the following
output:

```shell-session
$ nomad status -region="east"
Error querying jobs: Unexpected response code: 500 (No path to region)
```
