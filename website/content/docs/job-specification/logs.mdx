# `logs` Block

<Placement groups={['job', 'group', 'task', 'logs']} />

The `logs` block configures the log rotation policy for a task's `stdout` and
`stderr`. Logging is enabled by default with sane defaults (provided in the
parameters section below), and there is currently no way to disable logging for
tasks. The `logs` block allows for finer-grained control over how Nomad handles
log files.

Nomad's log rotation works by writing stdout/stderr output from tasks to a file
inside the `alloc/logs/` directory with the following format:
`<task-name>.<stdout/stderr>.<index>`. Output is written to a particular index,
starting at zero, till that log file hits the configured `max_file_size`. After,
a new file is created at `index + 1` and logs will then be written there. A log
file is never rolled over, instead Nomad will keep up to `max_files` worth of
logs and once that is exceeded, the log file with the lowest index is deleted.

```hcl
job "docs" {
  group "example" {
    task "server" {
      logs {
        max_files     = 10
        max_file_size = 10
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Each job's logs will be written to ephemeral disk space. If you increase the total
amount of logs on disk, you may want to increase ephemeral disk size as well. See
the [ephemeral disk documentation][] for more information.

For information on how to interact with logs after they have been configured,
please see the [`nomad alloc logs`][logs-command] command.

## `logs` Parameters

- `max_files` `(int: 10)` - Specifies the maximum number of rotated files Nomad
  will retain for `stdout` and `stderr`. Each stream is tracked individually, so
  specifying a value of 2 will create 4 files - 2 for stdout and 2 for stderr

- `max_file_size` `(int: 10)` - Specifies the maximum size of each rotated file
  in `MB`. If the amount of disk resource requested for the task is less than
  the total amount of disk space needed to retain the rotated set of files,
  Nomad will return a validation error when a job is submitted.

## `logs` Examples

The following examples only show the `logs` blocks. Remember that the
`logs` block is only valid in the placements listed above.

### Configure Defaults

This example shows a default logging configuration. Yes, it is empty on purpose.
Nomad automatically enables logging with sane defaults as described in the
parameters section above.

```hcl

```

### Customization

This example asks Nomad to retain 3 rotated files for each of `stderr` and
`stdout`, each a maximum size of 5 MB per file. The minimum disk space this
would require is 30 MB (3 `stderr` &plus; 3 `stdout` &times; 5 MB &equals; 30 MB).

```hcl
logs {
  max_files     = 3
  max_file_size = 5
}
```
