# Installing Nomad

Nomad is available as a pre-compiled binary or as a package for several
operating systems. You can also [build Nomad from source](#from-source).

-> If you are interested in trialing Nomad without installing it locally, see the
[Quickstart](/docs/install/quickstart) for options to get started with Nomad.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Manual installation" group="manual">

You can download a [precompiled binary](/downloads) and
run it on your machine locally. You can also verify the binary using the
available SHA-256 sums. After downloading Nomad, unzip the package. Make sure
that the `nomad` binary is available on your `PATH` before continuing with the
other guides.

<Tab heading="Homebrew on macOS" group="homebrew">

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is a free and open source package management system
for Mac OS X. Install the official [Nomad
formula](https://github.com/hashicorp/homebrew-tap) from the terminal.

First, install the HashiCorp tap, a repository of all of the HashiCorp Homebrew
packages.

```shell-session
$ brew tap hashicorp/tap
```

Now, install Nomad with `hashicorp/tap/nomad`.

```shell-session
$ brew install hashicorp/tap/nomad
```

~> **NOTE:** This installs a signed binary and is automatically updated with
every new official release.

To update to the latest, run

```shell-session
$ brew upgrade hashicorp/tap/nomad
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Chocolatey on Windows" group="chocolatey">

[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) is a free and open-source package
management system for Windows. Install the [Nomad
package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/nomad) from the command-line.

```shell-session
$ choco install nomad
```

~> **NOTE:** Chocolatey and the Nomad package are **NOT** directly maintained
by HashiCorp. The latest version of Nomad is always available by manual
installation.

## Post-installation steps

These steps are considered optional but can be helpful for running Nomad and to
take advantage of additional Nomad functionalities.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Manual installation" group="manual">

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Linux Packages">
<h3>Add the Nomad binary to your system path</h3>

Permanently add a new location to your path by editing your shell's settings
file (usually called something like `~/.bashrc`, where the part of the filename
after the `.` and before `rc` is the name of your shell). In that file you
should see a line that starts with `export PATH=`, followed by a
colon-separated list of locations. Add the location of the Nomad binary to that
list and save the file. Then reload your shell's configuration with the command
`source ~/.bashrc`, replacing `bash` with the name of your shell.

<h3>Install CNI plugins</h3>

Nomad uses CNI plugins to configure network namespaces when using the `bridge`
network mode. All Linux Nomad client nodes using network namespaces must have
CNI plugins installed.

The following commands install the CNI reference plugins.

```shell-session
$ curl -L -o cni-plugins.tgz "https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/v1.0.0/cni-plugins-linux-$( [ $(uname -m) = aarch64 ] && echo arm64 || echo amd64)"-v1.0.0.tgz && \
  sudo mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin && \
  sudo tar -C /opt/cni/bin -xzf cni-plugins.tgz
```

Ensure your Linux operating system distribution has been configured to allow
container traffic through the bridge network to be routed via iptables. These
tunables can be set as follows.

```shell-session
$ echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-arptables && \
  echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-ip6tables && \
  echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-iptables
```

To preserve these settings on startup of a client node, add a file including the
following to `/etc/sysctl.d/` or remove the file your Linux distribution puts in
that directory.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/sysctl.d/bridge.conf">

```ini
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

<h3>Add the Nomad binary to your system path</h3>

Add a location to your path via the GUI by navigating to `Environment
Variables` in your system settings, and looking for the variable called `PATH`.
You should see a semicolon-separated list of locations. Add the Nomad binary's
location to that list and then launch a new console window.

Note that if you are running Nomad on Linux, you'll need to run client agents as
root (or with `sudo`) so that cpuset accounting and network namespaces work
correctly.

<h3>Install CNI plugins</h3>

Nomad uses CNI plugins to configure network namespaces when using the `bridge`
network mode. All Linux Nomad client nodes using network namespaces must have
CNI plugins installed.

The following commands install the CNI reference plugins.

```shell-session
$ curl -L -o cni-plugins.tgz "https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/v1.0.0/cni-plugins-linux-$( [ $(uname -m) = aarch64 ] && echo arm64 || echo amd64)"-v1.0.0.tgz && \
  sudo mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin && \
  sudo tar -C /opt/cni/bin -xzf cni-plugins.tgz
```

Ensure your Linux operating system distribution has been configured to allow
container traffic through the bridge network to be routed via iptables. These
tunables can be set as follows.

```shell-session
$ echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-arptables && \
  echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-ip6tables && \
  echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-iptables
```

To preserve these settings on startup of a client node, add a file including the
following to `/etc/sysctl.d/` or remove the file your Linux distribution puts in
that directory.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/sysctl.d/bridge.conf">

```ini
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
```

## Compiling from Source ((#from-source))

To compile from source, you will need [Go](https://golang.org) installed and
configured properly (including a `GOPATH` environment variable set), as well
as a copy of [`git`](https://www.git-scm.com/) in your `PATH`.

1. Clone the Nomad repository from GitHub into your `GOPATH`:

   ```shell-session
   $ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp && cd $_
   $ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad.git
   $ cd nomad
   ```

1. Bootstrap the project. This will download and compile libraries and tools
   needed to compile Nomad:

   ```shell-session
   $ make bootstrap
   ```

1. Build Nomad for your current system and put the
   binary in `./bin/` (relative to the git checkout). The `make dev` target is
   just a shortcut that builds `nomad` for only your local build environment (no
   cross-compiled targets).

   ```shell-session
   $ make dev
   ```
