# Command: volume register

The `volume register` command registers external storage volumes with Nomad's
[Container Storage Interface (CSI)][csi] support. The volume must exist on the
remote storage provider before it can be registered and used by a task.

CSI plugins that implement the [Controller][csi_plugins_internals] interface
can be created via the [`volume create`] command, which will automatically
register the volume as well.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad volume register [options] [file]
```

The `volume register` command requires a single argument, specifying the path
to a file containing a valid [volume specification][volume_specification]. This
file will be read and the job will be submitted to Nomad for scheduling. If the
supplied path is "-", the job file is read from STDIN. Otherwise it is read
from the file at the supplied path.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the
`csi-write-volume` capability for the volume's namespace.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'
