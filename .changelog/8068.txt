```release-note:breaking-change
connect: Consul Service Identity ACL tokens automatically generated for Connect services are now
created as Local rather than Global tokens. Nomad clusters with Connect services making cross-Consul
datacenter requests will need to ensure their Consul agents are configured with anonymous ACL tokens
of sufficient node and service read permissions.
```

```release-note:breaking-change
connect: The minimum Consul version supported by Nomad's Connect integration is now Consul v1.8.0.
```
