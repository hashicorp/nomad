Nomad's task group networks and Consul Connect integration use bridge networking and iptables to send traffic between containers. The Linux kernel bridge module has three "tunables" that control whether iptables process traffic crossing the bridge. Some operating systems (RedHat, CentOS, and Fedora in particular) configure these tunables to optimize for VM workloads where iptables rules might not be correctly configured for guest traffic.

Ensure your Linux operating system distribution has been configured to allow
iptables to route container traffic through the bridge network. Set these tunables to allow iptables processing for the bridge network.

```shell-session
$ echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-arptables
$ echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-ip6tables
$ echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-iptables
```

To preserve these settings on startup of a client node, add a file including the following to `/etc/sysctl.d/` or remove the file your Linux distribution puts in that directory.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/sysctl.d/bridge.conf">

```ini
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
```
