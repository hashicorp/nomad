# Installing Nomad

Nomad is available as a pre-compiled binary or as a package for several
operating systems. You can also [build Nomad from source](#from-source).

-> If you are interested in trialing Nomad without installing it locally, see the
[Quickstart](/docs/install/quickstart) for options to get started with Nomad.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Manual installation">

You can download a [precompiled binary](/downloads) and
run it on your machine locally. You can also verify the binary using the
available SHA-256 sums. After downloading Nomad, unzip the package. Make sure
that the `nomad` binary is available on your `PATH` before continuing with the
other guides.

You can check the locations available on your path by running this command.

```shell-session
$ echo $PATH

/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
```

The output is a list of locations separated by colons. You can make Nomad
available by moving the binary to one of the listed locations, or by adding
Nomad's location to your `PATH`.

-> **Tip (Linux-based or Mac):** Permanently add a new location to your path by
editing your shell's settings file (usually called something like `~/.bashrc`,
where the part of the file name after the `.` and before `rc` is the name of
your shell). In that file you will see a line that starts with `export PATH=`,
followed by a colon-separated list of locations. Add the location of the Nomad
binary to that list and save the file. Then reload your shell's configuration
with the command `source ~/.bashrc`, replacing `bash` with the name of your
shell.

-> **Tip (Windows):** Add a location to your path via the GUI by navigating to
`Environment Variables` in your system settings, and looking for the variable
called `PATH`. You will see a semicolon-separated list of locations. Add the
Nomad binary's location to that list and then launch a new console window.

## Compiling from Source ((#from-source))

To compile from source, you will need [Go](https://golang.org) installed and
configured properly (including a `GOPATH` environment variable set), as well
as a copy of [`git`](https://www.git-scm.com/) in your `PATH`.

1. Clone the Nomad repository from GitHub into your `GOPATH`:

   ```shell-session
   $ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp && cd $_
   $ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad.git
   $ cd nomad
   ```

1. Bootstrap the project. This will download and compile libraries and tools
   needed to compile Nomad:

   ```shell-session
   $ make bootstrap
   ```

1. Build Nomad for your current system and put the
   binary in `./bin/` (relative to the git checkout). The `make dev` target is
   just a shortcut that builds `nomad` for only your local build environment (no
   cross-compiled targets).

   ```shell-session
   $ make dev
   ```
