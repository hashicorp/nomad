# `volume` Stanza

<Placement groups={['job', 'group', 'volume']} />

The `volume` stanza allows the group to specify that it requires a
given volume from the cluster.

The key of the stanza is the name of the volume as it will be exposed
to task configuration.

```hcl
job "docs" {
  group "example" {
    volume "certs" {
      type      = "host"
      source    = "ca-certificates"
      read_only = true
    }
  }
}
```

The Nomad server will ensure that the allocations are only scheduled
on hosts that have a set of volumes that meet the criteria specified
in the `volume` stanzas. These may be [host volumes][host_volume]
configured on the client, or [CSI volumes][csi_volume] dynamically
mounted by [CSI plugins][csi_plugin].

The Nomad client will make the volumes available to tasks according to
the [volume_mount][volume_mount] stanza in the `task` configuration.

## `volume` Parameters

- `type` `(string: "")` - Specifies the type of a given volume. The
  valid volume types are `"host"` and `"csi"`.

- `source` `(string: <required>)` - The name of the volume to
  request. When using `host_volume`'s this should match the published
  name of the host volume. When using `csi` volumes, this should match
  the ID of the registed volume.

- `read_only` `(bool: false)` - Specifies that the group only requires
  read only access to a volume and is used as the default value for
  the `volume_mount -> read_only` configuration. This value is also
  used for validating `host_volume` ACLs and for scheduling when a
  matching `host_volume` requires `read_only` usage.
