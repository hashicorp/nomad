  Rewrite Nomad config and job files to canonical format

# Command: fmt

The `fmt` commands check the syntax and rewrites Nomad configuration and jobspec
files to canonical format. It can be used to improve readability and enforce
consistency of style in Nomad files.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad fmt [flags] paths ...
```

Formats Nomad agent configuration and job file to a canonical format. If a path
is a directory, it will recursively format all files with .nomad and .hcl
extensions in the directory.

If you provide a single dash (-) as argument, fmt will read from standard input
(STDIN) and output the processed output to standard output (STDOUT).

## Format Options:

- `-list=false` :	Don't list the files, which contain formatting inconsistencies.
- `-check` : Check if the files are valid HCL files. If not, exit status of the command
    will be 1 and the incorrect files will not be formatted.
- `-write=false` : Don't overwrite the input files.
- `-recursive` : Process also files in subdirectories. By default only the given (or current) directory is processed.

## Examples

```shell-session
$ cat agent.hcl 
server {
    enabled = true
  bootstrap_expect = 1
}

client {
  enabled = true
}

$ nomad fmt

agent.hcl
$ cat agent.hcl 
server {
  enabled          = true
  bootstrap_expect = 1
}

client {
  enabled = true
}
```
