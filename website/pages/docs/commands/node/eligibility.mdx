# Command: node eligibility

The `node eligibility` command is used to toggle scheduling eligibility for a
given node. By default nodes are eligible for scheduling meaning they can
receive placements and run new allocations. Nodes that have their scheduling
eligibility disabled are ineligible for new placements.

The [`node drain`][drain] command automatically disables eligibility. Disabling
a drain restore eligibility by default.

Disable scheduling eligibility is useful when draining a set of nodes: first
disable eligibility on each node that will be drained. Then drain each node.
If you just drain each node allocations may get rescheduled multiple times as
they get placed on nodes about to be drained.

Disabling scheduling eligibility may also be useful when investigating poorly
behaved nodes. It allows operators to investigate the current state of a node
without the risk of additional work being assigned to it.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad node eligibility [options] <node>
```

A `-self` flag can be used to toggle eligibility of the local node. If this is
not supplied, a node ID or prefix must be provided. If there is an exact match,
the eligibility will be adjusted for that node. Otherwise, a list of matching
nodes and information will be displayed.

It is also required to pass one of `-enable` or `-disable`, depending on which
operation is desired.

If ACLs are enabled, this option requires a token with the 'node:write'
capability.

## General Options

@include 'general_options_no_namespace.mdx'

## Eligibility Options

- `-enable`: Enable scheduling eligibility.
- `-disable`: Disable scheduling eligibility.
- `-self`: Set eligibility for the local node.
- `-yes`: Automatic yes to prompts.

## Examples

Enable scheduling eligibility on node with ID prefix "574545c5":

```shell-session
$ nomad node eligibility -enable 574545c5
Node "574545c5-c2d7-e352-d505-5e2cb9fe169f" scheduling eligibility set: eligible for scheduling
```

Disable scheduling eligibility on the local node:

```shell-session
$ nomad node eligibility -disable -self
Node "574545c5-c2d7-e352-d505-5e2cb9fe169f" scheduling eligibility set: ineligible for scheduling
```
