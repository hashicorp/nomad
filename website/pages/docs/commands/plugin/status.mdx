# Command: plugin status

The `plugin status` command displays status information for [Container
Storage Interface (CSI)][csi] plugins.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad plugin status [options] [plugin]
```

This command accepts an optional plugin ID or prefix as the sole argument. If there
is an exact match based on the provided plugin ID or prefix, then information about
the specific plugin is queried and displayed. Otherwise, a list of matching plugins
and information will be displayed.

If the ID is omitted, the command lists out all of the existing plugins and a few
of the most useful status fields for each.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Status Options

- `-type`: Display only plugins of a particular type. Currently only
  the `csi` type is supported, so this option can be omitted when
  querying the status of CSI plugins.

- `-short`: Display short output. Used only when a single plugin is being queried.
  Drops verbose plugin allocation data from the output.

- `-verbose`: Show full information. Allocation create and modify times are
  shown in `yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss` format.
