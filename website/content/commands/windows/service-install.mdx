# `nomad windows service install` command reference

The `windows service install` command installs the nomad binary and
creates a Windows service.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad windows service install
```

The `windows service install` command will install the currently executing
nomad binary, create a data and configuration directory, write a basic
nomad configuration file, create a Windows service to run nomad, and
register the service with Windows eventlog.

If nomad has been previously installed using this command, subsequent
executions will: stop the service if it is running, install the currently
executing nomad binary, ensure data and configuration directory exist,
write configuration file if no configuration files are found, update
the service if needed, and update the eventlog configuration if needed.

## Options

- `-config-dir <dir>`: Directory to hold the nomad agent configuration. 

- `-data-dir <dir>`: Directory to hold the nomad agent state. 

- `-install-dir <dir>`: Directory to install the nomad binary.
