# nomad-pack destroy command reference

Stop and delete the specified Nomad pack from the configured Nomad cluster.
This is the same as using the command `nomad-pack stop <pack_name> --purge`.

By default, the `nomad-pack destroy` command deletes all jobs in the pack
deployment. If a pack was run using var overrides to specify the job name, you
must provide the var override when destroying the pack to guarantee Nomad Pack
targets the correct job in the pack deployment.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad-pack destroy <pack_name> [options]
```

## Options

- `-registry=<string>`: Specific registry name containing the pack to be
					destroyed.
- `-ref=<string>`: Specific Git reference of the pack to destroy.
					Supports tags, SHA, and latest. If no ref is specified,
					defaults to latest.	Using `ref` with a file path is not supported.
- `-global`: Destroy multi-region pack in all its regions. By default,
					 `destroy` only destroys a single region at a time. Ignored for single-region packs.

## Examples

Stop an example pack in deployment "dev" and delete it from the cluster.

```shell
nomad-pack destroy example --name=dev
```

Stop and delete an example pack in deployment "dev" that has a job named "test".
If you have installed the same pack in deployment "dev" but override the job
name to "hello", this command only "test".

```shell
nomad-pack destroy example --name=dev --var=job_name=test
```
