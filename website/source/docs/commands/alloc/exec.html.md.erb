# Command: alloc exec
**Alias: `nomad exec`**

The `alloc exec` command runs a command in a running allocation.

## Usage

```
nomad alloc exec [options] <allocation> <command> [<args>...]
```


This command runs the passed command inside the environment of the given allocation and task.

This command streams the exec of the given task in the allocation. If the
allocation is only running a single task, the task name can be omitted.
Optionally, the `-job` option may be used in which case a random allocation from
the given job will be chosen.

## General Options

<%= partial "docs/commands/_general_options" %>

## Exec Options

* `task`: Sets the task to exec command in.  Defaults to first task

* `-job`: Use a random allocation from the specified job ID.

* `-i`: Pass stdin to the container, defaults to true.  Pass `-i=false` to disable explicitly.

* `-t`: Allocate a pseudo-tty, defaults to true if stdin is detected to be a tty session.  Pass `-t=false` to disable explicitly.


## Examples

```
$ nomad alloc exec eb17e557 /bin/sh
/ # echo hi
hi

$ nomad alloc exec eb17e557 echo hi
hi

$ nomad alloc exec -job example echo hi
hi
```

## Using Job ID instead of Allocation ID

Setting the `-job` flag causes a random allocation of the specified job to be
selected.

```
nomad alloc exec -job <job-id> <command> [<args>...]
```


This can be useful for debugging a job that has multiple allocations, and it's
not really required to use a specific allocation ID.
