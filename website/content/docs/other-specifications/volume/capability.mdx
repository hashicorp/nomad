# `capability` Block

<Placement
  groups={[
    ['volume', 'capability'],
  ]}
/>

The `capability` block allows validating that a volume meets the requested
capabilities.

```hcl
id           = "ebs_prod_db1"
namespace    = "default"
name         = "database"
type         = "csi"
plugin_id    = "ebs-prod"
capacity_max = "200G"
capacity_min = "100G"

capability {
  access_mode     = "single-node-reader-only"
  attachment_mode = "file-system"
}
```

You must provide at least one `capability` block, and you must provide a block
for each capability you intend to use in a job's [`volume`] block.

## `capability` Parameters

- `access_mode` `(string: <required>)` - Defines whether a volume should be
available concurrently. Can be one of `"single-node-reader-only"`,
`"single-node-writer"`, `"multi-node-reader-only"`,
`"multi-node-single-writer"`, or `"multi-node-multi-writer"`. Most CSI plugins
support only single-node modes. Consult the documentation of the storage
provider and CSI plugin. Can be one of the following:

    - `"single-node-reader-only"`: Jobs can only request the volume with
      read-only access, and only one node can mount the volume at a time.
    - `"single-node-writer"`: Jobs can request the volume with read/write or
      read-only access, and only one node can mount the volume at a time.
    - `"multi-node-reader-only"`: Jobs can only request the volume with
      read-only access, but multiple nodes can mount the volume simultaneously.
    - `"multi-node-single-writer"`: Jobs can request the volume with read/write
      or read-only access, but the scheduler only allows one allocation to have
      read/write access. Multiple nodes can mount the volume simultaneously.
    - `"multi-node-multi-writer"`: Jobs can request the volume with read/write
      or read-only access, and the scheduler allows multiple allocations to have
      read/write access. Multiple nodes can mount the volume simultaneously.

- `attachment_mode` `(string: <required>)` - The storage API that will be used
by the volume. Most storage providers will support `"file-system"`, to mount
volumes using the CSI filesystem API. Some storage providers will support
`"block-device"`, which will mount the volume with the CSI block device API
within the container.

## `capability` Examples

The following examples only show the `capability` blocks. Remember that the
`capability` block is only valid in the placement shown above.

### Multiple capabilities

This examples shows a volume that must satisfy multiple capability
requirements.

```hcl
capability {
  access_mode     = "single-node-reader-only"
  attachment_mode = "file-system"
}

capability {
  access_mode     = "single-node-writer"
  attachment_mode = "file-system"
}
```
