// Package executor is used to invoke child processes across various operating
// systems in a way that provides the following features:
//
// - Least privilege
// - Resource constraints
// - Process isolation
//
// An operating system may be something like "windows" or "linux with systemd".
// Executors allow drivers like `exec` and `java` to share an implementation
// for isolation capabilities on a particular operating system.
//
// For example:
//
// - `exec` and `java` on Linux use a cgroups executor
// - `exec` and `java` on FreeBSD use a jails executor
//
// However, drivers that provide their own isolation should not use executors.
// For example, using an executor to start QEMU means that the QEMU call is
// run inside a chroot+cgroup, even though the VM already provides isolation for
// the task running inside it. This is an extraneous level of indirection.
