    should be deleted before starting for the first time [GH-675]

    a `mode` field. The `mode` can be either `fail` or `delay`. The default for
    `batch` and `service` jobs is `fail` and `delay` respectively [GH-594]
  * All jobs that interpret variables in constraints or driver configurations
    will need to be updated to the new syntax which wraps the interpreted
    variable in curly braces. (`$node.class` becomes `${node.class}`) [GH-760]
