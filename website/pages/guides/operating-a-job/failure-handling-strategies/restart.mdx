# Restart Stanza

To enable restarting a failed task on the node it is running on, the task group can be annotated
with configurable options using the [`restart` stanza][restart]. Nomad will restart the failed task
up to `attempts` times within a provided `interval`. Operators can also choose whether to
keep attempting restarts on the same node, or to fail the task so that it can be rescheduled
on another node, via the `mode` parameter.

We recommend setting mode to `fail` in the restart stanza to allow rescheduling the task on another node.

## Example

The following CLI example shows job status and allocation status for a failed task that is being restarted by Nomad.
Allocations are in the `pending` state while restarts are attempted. The `Recent Events` section in the CLI
shows ongoing restart attempts.

```shell
$nomad job status demo
ID            = demo
Name          = demo
Submit Date   = 2018-04-12T14:37:18-05:00
Type          = service
Priority      = 50
Datacenters   = dc1
Status        = running
Periodic      = false
Parameterized = false

Summary
Task Group  Queued  Starting  Running  Failed  Complete  Lost
demo        0       3         0        0       0         0

Allocations
ID        Node ID   Task Group  Version  Desired  Status   Created  Modified
ce5bf1d1  8a184f31  demo        0        run      pending  27s ago  5s ago
d5dee7c8  8a184f31  demo        0        run      pending  27s ago  5s ago
ed815997  8a184f31  demo        0        run      pending  27s ago  5s ago
```

In the following example, the allocation `ce5bf1d1` is restarted by Nomad approximately
every ten seconds, with a small random jitter. It eventually reaches its limit of three attempts and
transitions into a `failed` state, after which it becomes eligible for [rescheduling][rescheduling].

```shell
$nomad alloc-status ce5bf1d1
ID                     = ce5bf1d1
Eval ID                = 64e45d11
Name                   = demo.demo[1]
Node ID                = a0ccdd8b
Job ID                 = demo
Job Version            = 0
Client Status          = failed
Client Description     = <none>
Desired Status         = run
Desired Description    = <none>
Created                = 56s ago
Modified               = 22s ago
