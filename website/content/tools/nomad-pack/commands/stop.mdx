# nomad-pack stop command reference

Use the `nomad-pack stop` command to stop the specified Nomad Pack in the configured Nomad cluster.

By default, the `stop` command stops all jobs in the pack deployment. If you ran
a pack with variable overrides to specify the job name, you must provide the
same variable overrides when stopping the pack to guarantee that this command
targets the correct job in the pack deployment.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad-pack stop <pack_name> [options]
```

To delete the pack from the cluster, specify `--purge`, or use the [`nomad-pack
destroy` command](/nomad/tools/nomad-pack/commands/destroy).

## Options

- `-registry=<string>`: Specific registry name containing the pack to be
  stopped.
- `-ref=<string>`: Specific Git reference of the pack to retrieve info about.
  Supports tags, SHA, and `@latest`. If you do not specify a reference, the
  value defaults to `@latest`. Using `ref` with a file path is not supported.
- `-purge`: Purge is used to stop a pack and purge it from the system.	If not
  set, you can still query the pack until the garbage collector purges the pack.
- `-global`: Stop a multi-region pack in all its regions. By default, `pack
  stop` only stops a single region at a time. Ignored for	single-region jobs.

## Examples

Stop an example pack in deployment "dev".

```shell
nomad-pack stop example --name=dev
```

Stop the `example` pack in deployment "dev" and purge it from the system.

```shell
nomad-pack stop example --name=dev --purge
```

Stop an example pack in deployment "dev" that has a job named "test"
If the same pack has been installed in deployment "dev" but overriding the
job name to "hello", only "test" is stopped.

```shell
nomad-pack stop example --name=dev --var=job_name=test
```
