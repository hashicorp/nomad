# Command: run

The `run` command is used to submit new jobs to Nomad or to update existing
jobs. Job files must conform to the [job specification](/docs/jobspec/index.html)
format.

## Usage

```
nomad run [options] <file>
```

The run command requires a single argument, specifying the path to a file
containing a valid [job specification](/docs/jobspec/index.html). This file
will be read and the job will be submitted to Nomad for scheduling.

By default, on successful job submission the run command will enter an
interactive monitor and display log information detailing the scheduling
decisions and placement information for the provided job. The monitor will
exit after scheduling has finished or failed.

On successful job submission and scheduling, exit code 0 will be returned. If
there are job placement issues encountered (unsatisfiable constraints, resource
exhaustion, etc), then the exit code will be 2. Any other errors, including
client connection issues or internal errors, are indicated by exit code 1.

## General Options

<%= general_options_usage %>

## Run Options

* `-detach`: Return immediately instead of monitoring. A new evaluation ID
  will be output, which can be used to call the monitor later using the
  [eval-monitor](/docs/commands/eval-monitor.html) command.

* `-output`: Output the JSON that would be submitted to the HTTP API without
  submitting the job.

## Status Options

* `-verbose`: Show full information.

## Examples

Schedule the job contained in the file `job1.nomad`, monitoring placement:

```
$ nomad run job1.nomad
==> Monitoring evaluation "52dee78a"
    Allocation "5e0b39f0" created: node "3e84d3d2", group "group1"
    Allocation "5e0b39f0" status changed: "pending" -> "running"
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "52dee78a" finished with status "complete"
```

Schedule the job contained in `job1.nomad` and return immediately:

```
$ nomad run -detach job1.nomad
4947e728
```

Schedule a job which cannot get placement. This results in a scheduling failure
and the specifics of the placement are printed:

```
$ nomad run failing.nomad
==> Monitoring evaluation "0d7447d9"
    Scheduling error for group "group1" (failed to find a node for placement)
    Allocation "a739288e" status "failed" (1/1 nodes filtered)
      * Constraint "$attr.kernel.name = linux" filtered 1 nodes
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "0d7447d9" finished with status "complete"
```
