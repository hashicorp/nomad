# Fixed Value Strategy Plugin

The `fixed-value` strategy receives a count value as an input configuration
option and returns a scaling action whose count is set to the same value. This
strategy is useful in situations where thereâ€™s a known baseline for the
infrastructure that does not change often.

## Agent Configuration Options

```hcl
strategy "fixed-value" {
  driver = "fixed-value"
}
```

## Policy Configuration Options

```hcl
check "fixed-value-check" {
  # ...
  strategy "fixed-value" {
    value = 3
  }
  # ...
}
```

- `value` `(int: <required>)` - The value used by the Nomad Autoscaler to set
  the target count.
