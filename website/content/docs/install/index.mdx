# Installing Nomad

Nomad is available as a pre-compiled binary or as a package for several
operating systems. You can also [build Nomad from source](#from-source).

-> If you are interested in trialing Nomad without installing it locally, see the
[Quickstart](/nomad/docs/install/quickstart) for options to get started with Nomad.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Manual installation" group="manual">

You can download a [precompiled binary](/nomad/downloads) and
run it on your machine locally. You can also verify the binary using the
available SHA-256 sums. After downloading Nomad, unzip the package. Make sure
that the `nomad` binary is available on your `PATH` before continuing with the
other guides.

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is a free and open source package management system
for Mac OS X. Install the official [Nomad
formula](https://github.com/hashicorp/homebrew-tap) from the terminal.

First, install the HashiCorp tap, a repository of all of the HashiCorp Homebrew
packages.

```shell-session
$ brew tap hashicorp/tap
```

Now, install Nomad with `hashicorp/tap/nomad`.

```shell-session
$ brew install hashicorp/tap/nomad
```

~> **NOTE:** This installs a signed binary and is automatically updated with
every new official release.

To update to the latest, run

```shell-session
$ brew upgrade hashicorp/tap/nomad
```

## Post-installation steps

These steps are considered optional but can be helpful for running Nomad and to
take advantage of additional Nomad functionalities.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Manual installation" group="manual">

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Linux">

### Add the Nomad binary to your system path

Permanently add a new location to your path by editing your shell's settings
file (usually called something like `~/.bashrc`, where the part of the filename
after the `.` and before `rc` is the name of your shell). In that file you
should see a line that starts with `export PATH=`, followed by a
colon-separated list of locations. Add the location of the Nomad binary to that
list and save the file. Then reload your shell's configuration with the command
`source ~/.bashrc`, replacing `bash` with the name of your shell.

### Install CNI reference plugins

@include 'install/install-cni-plugins.mdx'
 
### Install consul-cni plugin

@include 'install/install-consul-cni-plugin-manual.mdx'

### Configure bridge network to route traffic through iptables

@include 'install/bridge-iptables.mdx'

### Verify cgroup controllers

@include 'install/cgroup-controllers.mdx'

### Add the Nomad binary to your system path

Add a location to your path via the GUI by navigating to `Environment
Variables` in your system settings, and looking for the variable called `PATH`.
You should see a semicolon-separated list of locations. Add the Nomad binary's
location to that list and then launch a new console window.

Note that if you are running Nomad on Linux, you'll need to run client agents as
root (or with `sudo`) so that cpuset accounting and network namespaces work
correctly.

## Compiling from Source ((#from-source))

To compile from source, you will need [Go](https://golang.org) installed at the
version described by the [.go-version][go-version] file. You should properly
configure your Go environment, including setting a `GOPATH` environment variable
and ensuring `GOPATH/bin` is within your `PATH`. A copy of
[`git`](https://www.git-scm.com/) is also needed in your `PATH`.

1. Clone the Nomad repository from GitHub into your `GOPATH`:

   ```shell-session
   $ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp && cd $_
   $ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad.git
   $ cd nomad
   ```

1. Bootstrap the project. This will download and compile libraries and tools
   needed to compile Nomad:

   ```shell-session
   $ make bootstrap
   ```

1. Build Nomad for your current system and put the
   binary in `./bin/` (relative to the git checkout). The `make dev` target is
   just a shortcut that builds `nomad` for only your local build environment (no
   cross-compiled targets).

   ```shell-session
   $ make dev
   ```
