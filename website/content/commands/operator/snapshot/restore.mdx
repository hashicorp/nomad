  Restore snapshot of Nomad server state

# Command: operator snapshot restore

The `operator snapshot restore` command restores an atomic, point-in-time
snapshot of the state of the Nomad servers, which includes jobs, nodes,
allocations, periodic jobs, and ACLs.

Restoration involves a potentially dangerous low-level Raft operation that is
not designed to handle server failures during a restore. This command is
primarily intended for recovering from a disaster, restoring into a
fresh cluster of Nomad servers.

<Warning>

This command only restores the Raft snapshot, which does not include keyrings.

If you are recovering a cluster, you also need to restore the keyring onto at
least one server.  Refer to the Key Management's [Restoring the
Keyring from Backup][restore the keyring] section for instructions.

</Warning>

If you enabled ACLs, you must supply a management token in order to perform
snapshot operations.

This example srestore a snapshot from the file `backup.snap`.

```shell-session
$ nomad operator snapshot restore backup.snap
```

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad operator snapshot restore [options] <file>
