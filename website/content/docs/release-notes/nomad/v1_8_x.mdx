# Nomad 1.8.0

We are pleased to announce the following Nomad updates.

## Release highlights

- **Long Term Support Release (Enterprise):** Nomad 1.8 introduces a [long
  term support release](/nomad/docs/enterprise#long-term-support-lts-releases) which provides extended maintenance (two years of
  critical fixes provided through minor releases and efficient upgrades
  (support for direct upgrades from one LTS release to the next).

- **Exec2 Task Driver (beta):** The `exec2` driver is used to execute a
  command for a task. It offers a security model optimized for running
  'ordinary' processes with very low startup times and minimal overhead in
  terms of CPU, disk, and memory utilization. The `exec2` driver leverages
  kernel features such as the Landlock LSM, cgroups v2, and the unshare system
  utility. Due these enhancements, tasks no longer require leveraging
  filesystem isolation based on chroot, which provide an enhanced security
  profile and improved performance for the Nomad operator. Refer to [Exec2 Task
  Driver](/nomad/plugins/v1.8.x/drivers/exec2) for more details.
  
- **Transparent proxy support for Consul service mesh:** Transparent Proxy
  introduces a more seamless way of dialing upstream services when Consul service
  mesh is enabled. Users can configure services to use transparent proxy with a
  new [`transparent_proxy`](/nomad/docs/v1.8.x/job-specification/transparent_proxy)
  block. When a service is configured to use transparent proxy, workloads can now dial the 
  service using a virtual IP Consul DNS name.

- **Consul API Gateway for Nomad:** Consul API Gateway on Nomad is now
  officially supported. A prescriptive job specification on
  [hashicorp-guides/consul-api-gateway-on-nomad](https://github.com/hashicorp-guides/consul-api-gateway-on-nomad)
  along with a supporting [tutorial](/nomad/tutorials/integrate-consul/deploy-api-gateway-on-nomad) on
  how to securely deploy Consul API gateway on Nomad.
  
- **Re-worked Jobs page in the web UI with live updates:** Within the [Jobs index](/nomad/tutorials/web-ui/web-ui-workload-info#list-jobs) 
  page Nomad has made a few improvements:

  - **Prioirtize showing the current state over historical state for jobs:**
  Previously, long-garbage-collected allocation placement failures, lost nodes,
  and other historical representations of job state were shown alongside
  currently running allocations. In self-healing jobs, this often meant that a
  healthy job looked like it had failures, when in fact Nomad had replaced or
  rescheduled those failures. Now, the jobs list tries to show accurate
  allocation information and meaningful statuses (like "Degraded", or
  "Recovering") to better illustrate the current state of a job. 
  - **Server-side pagination:** For users with many thousands of jobs, the main
  landing page for the web UI will no longer have a noticeable delay on
  rendering. Users can control page length and filter paginated jobs
  appropriately. 
  - **Live updates:** Previously, users had to manually refresh
  the page to see newly created jobs, or to hide jobs that had been stopped and
  garbage-collected. Now, the jobs list will update in real-time as jobs are
  created, updated, or removed. Further, any changes to allocations of jobs
  on-page will be reflected in the status of that job in real-time.
  
- **Time based task execution:** Using a CRON-like syntax, operators can now
  schedule when tasks should execute and when they should stop. This provides
  governance for tasks executed from jobs, and allows operators to easily opt-in 
  or opt-out of a schedule that governs when the task can run through the web based UI.

- **Sentinel policy management in the Web UI:** Enterprise users can manage
  Sentinel policies directly within the Nomad UI. Users can create a Sentinel
  policy based on a template provided from the UI or create policies directly
  using an editor for Sentinel policies. Refer to [Sentinel policies](/nomad/tutorials/governance-and-policy/sentinel)
  to learn more about how to use Sentinel within Nomad. 

- **nomad-bench:** Nomad now provides a testing framework through [nomad-bench](https://github.com/hashicorp-forge/nomad-bench) 
  which provisions infrastructure used to run tests and benchmarks against
  Nomad test clusters. The infrastructure consists of Nomad test clusters that
  each have a set of servers with hundreds or thousands of simulated nodes
  created using nomad-nodesim. The Nomad server processes are not simulated and
  are expected to run on their own hosts, mimicking real-world deployments.
  Metrics are then gathered from the Nomad servers for use with benchmarking
  and load testing.

## What's deprecated

- **LXC Task driver:** The [Community LXC Task
  Driver](/nomad/plugins/drivers/community/lxc) is now deprecated. Official
  support will be removed and the repo will be archived when Nomad 1.9 is
  released. Users are encouraged to migrate their workloads to another task
  driver such as the built-in Docker task driver[/nomad/docs/drivers/docker].
  
- **ECS Task driver:** The remote [ECS Task
  Driver](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/plugins/drivers/remote/ecs) is
  now deprecated. Official support will be removed and the repo will be
  archived when Nomad 1.9 is released. Users are encouraged to migrate their
  workloads to Amazon ECS or to another Nomad task driver.
  
- **`stop_after_client_disconnect`, `max_client_disconnect`,
  `prevent_reschedule_on_lost`:** Nomad 1.8.0 introduces a [disconnect](/nomad/docs/job-specification/disconnect)
  block meant to group all the configuration options related to disconnected
  client's and server's behavior, causing the deprecation of the fields
  stop_after_client_disconnect, max_client_disconnect and
  prevent_reschedule_on_lost. This block also introduces new options for
  allocations reconciliation if the client regains connectivity.
  
  
## What's removed

- **raw_exec option `no_cgroups`:** In Nomad 1.7.0 the raw_exec plugin option
  for no_cgroups became ineffective. Starting in Nomad 1.8.0 attempting to set
  the no_cgroups in raw_exec plugin configuration will result in an error when
  starting the agent.
