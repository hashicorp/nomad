# Command: alloc-status

The `alloc-status` command displays status information and metadata about an
existing allocation and its tasks. It can be useful while debugging to reveal
the underlying reasons for scheduling decisions or failures, as well as the
current state of its tasks.

## Usage

```
nomad alloc-status [options] <allocation>
```

An allocation ID must be provided. This specific allocation will be queried
and detailed information for it will be dumped.

## General Options

<%= general_options_usage %>
#
## Status Options

* `-short`: Display short output. Shows only the most recent task event.

## Examples

Short status of an alloc:

```
$ nomad alloc-status --short a7365fe4-8b9f-4284-612d-a101fb41e773
