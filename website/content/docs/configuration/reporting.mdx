# `reporting` Block in Agent Configuration

<Placement groups={['reporting']} />
<EnterpriseAlert product="nomad"/>

This page provides reference information for enabling automated license
utilization reporting in the `reporting` block of a Nomad agent configuration.

Configuration applies to agents running with [server mode
enabled][server_mode_enabled].

Refer to the [Automated license utilization reporting
guide][automated_license_utilization_reporting] for which ports to open and what
data is shared.

```hcl
reporting {
  license {
    enabled = true
  }

  snapshot_retention_time = "9600h"
}
```

## `reporting` Parameters

- `license` <code>([license](#license-block): default)</code> - Configures
  automated license utilization reporting.

- `snapshot_retention_time` `(string: "9600h")` - Configures the maximum amount
  of time that Nomad retains a utilization reporting snapshot in the Nomad
  state store. You can export these snapshots with the [`nomad operator
  utilization`][] command.

## `license` Block

- `enabled` `(bool: true)` - Specifies whether automated license utilization
  reporting should be enabled and run.
