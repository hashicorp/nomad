# `ephemeral_disk` Block

<Placement groups={['job', 'group', 'ephemeral_disk']} />

The `ephemeral_disk` block describes the ephemeral disk requirements of the
group. Ephemeral disks can be marked as sticky and support live data migrations.
All tasks in this group will share the same ephemeral disk.

```hcl
job "docs" {
  group "example" {
    ephemeral_disk {
      migrate = true
      size    = 500
      sticky  = true
    }
  }
}
```

The ephemeral disk can be referenced under `alloc/data/`. More information can
be found in the [filesystem internals][].

Each job's logs will be written to ephemeral disk space. See the [logs
documentation][] for more information.

## `ephemeral_disk` Parameters

- `migrate` `(bool: false)` - This specifies that the Nomad client should make a
  best-effort attempt to migrate the data from the previous allocation, even if
  the previous allocation was on another client. Enabling `migrate`
  automatically enables `sticky` as well. During data migration, the task will
  block starting until the data migration has completed.

  Successful migration requires that the clients can reach each other directly
  over the Nomad HTTP port. Any failure of the transfer will result in data
  loss, so this feature is only suitable for data that can be recreated at the
  destination (for example, cache data). Migration is atomic and any partially
  migrated data will be removed from the destination if an error is
  encountered. Note that data migration will not take place if a client garbage
  collects a failed allocation or if the allocation has been intentionally
  stopped via `nomad alloc stop`, because the original allocation has already
  been removed.

- `size` `(int: 300)` - Specifies the size of the ephemeral disk in MB. The
  current Nomad ephemeral storage implementation does not enforce this limit;
  however, it is used during job placement.

- `sticky` `(bool: false)` - Specifies that Nomad should make a best-effort
  attempt to place the updated allocation on the same machine. This will move
  the `local/` and `alloc/data` directories to the new allocation.
