# Jail task Driver

Name: `jail-task-driver`

The Jail task driver provides an interface for using FreeBSD jails for running application
containers. You can download the external jail-task-driver [here][jail-task-driver]. For more detailed instructions on how to set up and use this driver, please refer to the [guide][jail-task-guide].

## Task Configuration

```hcl
task "http-echo-jail" {
		driver = "jail-task-driver"
		config {
			Path  = "/zroot/iocage/jails/myjail/root"
			Allow_raw_sockets = true
			Allow_chflags     = true
			Ip4_addr          = "em1|192.168.1.102"
			Exec_start        = "/usr/local/bin/http-echo -listen :9999 -text hello"
			Rctl =  {
				Vmemoryuse = {
					Action = "deny"
					Amount = "1G"
					Per = "process"
				}
				Openfiles = {
					Action = "deny"
					Amount = "500"
				}
			}
		}
	}
```

The Jail task driver supports most of [JAIL(8)][jail(8)] parameters, for a list of the currently supported parameters, please refer to the [Parameter Documentation][parameter-doc].

- `Path` - (Optional) The directory which is to be the root of the jail.
  Defaults to the [allocation working directory].

- `Ip4` - (Optional) Control the availability of IPv4 addresses. Possible values are
  **"inherit"** to allow unrestricted access to all system addresses,
  **"new"** to restrict addresses via Ip4_addr, and "**disable"** to stop
  the jail from using IPv4 entirely.

~> Note : Setting the Ip4_addr parameter implies a value of **"new"**

- `Ip4_addr` - (Optional) A list of IPv4 addresses assigned to the jail. If this is set,
  the jail is restricted to using only these addresses. Any attempts to use other addresses fail,
  and attempts to use wildcard addresses silently use the jailed address instead. For
  IPv4 the first address given will be used as the source address when source address selection on
  unbound sockets cannot find a better match. It is only possible to start multiple jails with
  the same IP address if none of the jails has more than this
  single overlapping IP address assigned to itself.

- `Allow_raw_sockets` - (Optional) The jail root is allowed to create raw sockets. Setting
  this parameter allows utilities like ping(8) and traceroute(8) to operate inside the jail.
  If this is set, the source IP addresses are enforced to comply with the IP address bound to the jail,
  regardless of whether or not the IP_HDRINCL flag has been set on the socket.
  Since raw sockets can be used to configure and interact with various network subsystems, extra caution
  should be used where privileged access to jails is given out to untrusted parties.

## Resource Isolation

Resource isolation on jails is enforced by [RCTL(8)][rctl-doc] all parameters for resource control
are supported.

- `Rctl` - (Optional) Set resource limits on the jail, for a list of currently supported parameters, please refer to the [Parameter Documentation][parameter-doc].

      	* `Vmemoryuse`   - (Optional) Address space limit,in bytes
      	* `Cputime`      - (Optional) CPU time, in seconds
      	* `Datasize`     - (Optional)  data	size, in bytes
      	* `Stacksize`    - (Optional   stack size, in bytes
      	* `Coredumpsize` - (Optional)	   core	dump size, in bytes
      	* `Memoryuse`    - (Optional)	   resident set size, in bytes
      	* `Memorylocked` - (Optional)	   locked memory, in bytes
      	* `Maxproc`      - (Optional)		   number of processes
      	* `Openfiles`    - (Optional)	   file	descriptor table size
      	* `Vmemoryuse`   - (Optional) 	   address space limit,in bytes
      	* `Pseudoterminals`  - (Optional)	   number of PTYs
      	* `Swapuse`  - (Optional)		   swap	space that may be reserved or used, in bytes
      	* `Nthr`  - (Optional)		   number of threads
      	* `Msgqqueued`  - (Optional) 	   number of queued SysV messages
      	* `Msgqsize`  - (Optional)	   SysV	message	queue size, in bytes
      	* `Nmsgq`  - (Optional)		   number of SysV message queues
      	* `Nsem`  - (Optional)		   number of SysV semaphores
      	* `Nsemop`  - (Optional)		   number of SysV semaphores modified in a single semop(2) call
      	* `Nshm`  - (Optional)		   number of SysV shared memory	segments
      	* `Shmsize`  - (Optional)		   SysV	shared memory size, in bytes
      	* `Wallclock`  - (Optional)	   wallclock time, in seconds
      	* `Pcpu`  - (Optional)		   %CPU, in percents of	a single CPU core
      	* `Readbps`  - (Optional)		   filesystem reads, in	bytes per second
      	* `Writebps`  - (Optional)	   filesystem writes, in bytes per second
      	* `Readiops`  - (Optional)	   filesystem reads, in	operations per second
      	* `Writeiops`  - (Optional)	   filesystem writes, in operations per	second

## Networking

The job spec could specify the `Ip4addr` parameter to add the jail's ip address to an specific interface at jail
startup or the `Vnet` parameter to create a virtual network stack. Please refer to [JAIL(8)][jail(8)] for more details.

- `vnet jail` - Example taken from Lucas, Michael W. FreeBSD Mastery: Jails (IT Mastery Book 15).

```hcl
 task "test01" {
      driver = "jail-task-driver"
      config {
		Path    = "/zroot/iocage/jails/myjail/root"
		Host_hostname = "nomad00"
		Exec_clean = true
		Exec_start = "sh /etc/rc"
		Exec_stop = "sh /etc/rc.shutdown"
		Mount_devfs = true
		Exec_prestart = "logger trying to start "
		Exec_poststart = "logger jail has started"
		Exec_prestop = "logger shutting down jail "
		Exec_poststop = "logger has shut down jail "
		Exec_consolelog ="/var/tmp/vnet-example"
		Vnet = true
		Vnet_nic = "e0b_loghost"
		Exec_prestart = "/usr/share/examples/jails/jib addm loghost em1"
		Exec_poststop = "/usr/share/examples/jails/jib destroy loghost "
      }
    }
```

## Client Requirements

`jail-task-driver` requires the following:

- 64-bit FreeBSD 12.0-RELEASE host
- The FreeBSD's Nomad binary
- The jail-task-driver binary placed in the [plugin_dir][plugin_dir] directory.
- If resource control is going be used then [RACCT][racct-doc] must be enabled
