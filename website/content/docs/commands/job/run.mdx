# Command: job run

**Alias: `nomad run`**

The `job run` command is used to submit new jobs to Nomad or to update existing
jobs. Job files must conform to the [job specification] format.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad job run [options] <job file>
```

The `job run` command requires a single argument, specifying the path to a file
containing a valid [job specification]. This file will be read and the job will
be submitted to Nomad for scheduling. If the supplied path is "-", the job file
is read from STDIN. Otherwise it is read from the file at the supplied path or
downloaded and read from URL specified. Nomad downloads the job file using
[`go-getter`] and supports `go-getter` syntax.

By default, on successful job submission the run command will enter an
interactive monitor and display log information detailing the scheduling
decisions and placement information for the provided job. The monitor will
exit after scheduling has finished or failed.

On successful job submission and scheduling, exit code 0 will be returned. If
there are job placement issues encountered (unsatisfiable constraints, resource
exhaustion, etc), then the exit code will be 2. Any other errors, including
client connection issues or internal errors, are indicated by exit code 1.

If the job has specified the region, the `-region` flag and `$NOMAD_REGION`
environment variable are overridden and the job's region is used.

The run command will set the `consul_token` of the job based on the following
precedence, going from highest to lowest: the `-consul-token` flag, the
`$CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN` environment variable and finally the value in the job file.

The run command will set the `vault_token` of the job based on the following
precedence, going from highest to lowest: the `-vault-token` flag, the
`$VAULT_TOKEN` environment variable and finally the value in the job file.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the `submit-job`
capability for the job's namespace. Jobs that mount CSI volumes require a
token with the `csi-mount-volume` capability for the volume's namespace. Jobs
that mount host volumes require a token with the `host_volume` capability for
that volume.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Run Options

- `-check-index`: If set, the job is only registered or
  updated if the passed job modify index matches the server side version.
  If a check-index value of zero is passed, the job is only registered if it does
  not yet exist. If a non-zero value is passed, it ensures that the job is being
  updated from a known state. The use of this flag is most common in conjunction
  with [`job plan` command].

- `-detach`: Return immediately instead of monitoring. A new evaluation ID
  will be output, which can be used to examine the evaluation using the
  [eval status] command.

- `-output`: Output the JSON that would be submitted to the HTTP API without
  submitting the job.

- `-policy-override`: Sets the flag to force override any soft mandatory
  Sentinel policies.

- `-preserve-counts`: If set, the existing task group counts will be preserved
  when updating a job.

- `-consul-token`: If set, the passed Consul token is stored in the job before
  sending to the Nomad servers. This allows passing the Consul token without
  storing it in the job file. This overrides the token found in the
  `$CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN` environment variable and that found in the job.

- `-vault-token`: If set, the passed Vault token is stored in the job before
  sending to the Nomad servers. This allows passing the Vault token without
  storing it in the job file. This overrides the token found in the
  `$VAULT_TOKEN` environment variable and that found in the job.

- `-hcl1`: If set, HCL1 parser is used for parsing the job spec.

- `-verbose`: Show full information.

## Examples

Schedule the job contained in the file `job1.nomad`, monitoring placement:

```shell-session
$ nomad job run job1.nomad
==> Monitoring evaluation "52dee78a"
    Evaluation triggered by job "example"
    Evaluation within deployment: "62eb607c"
    Allocation "5e0b39f0" created: node "3e84d3d2", group "group1"
    Allocation "5e0b39f0" status changed: "pending" -> "running"
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "52dee78a" finished with status "complete"
```

<a id="check-index"></a> Update the job using `check-index`:

```shell-session
$ nomad job run -check-index 5 example.nomad
Enforcing job modify index 5: job exists with conflicting job modify index: 6
Job not updated

$ nomad job run -check-index 6 example.nomad
==> Monitoring evaluation "5ef16dff"
    Evaluation triggered by job "example"
    Evaluation within deployment: "62eb607c"
    Allocation "6ec7d16f" modified: node "6e1f9bf6", group "cache"
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "5ef16dff" finished with status "complete"
```

Schedule the job contained in `job1.nomad` and return immediately:

```shell-session
$ nomad job run -detach job1.nomad
Job registration successful
Evaluation ID: e18819c1-b83d-dc17-5e7b-b6f264990283
```

Schedule a job which cannot be successfully placed. This results in a scheduling
failure and the specifics of the placement are printed:

```shell-session
$ nomad job run failing.nomad
==> Monitoring evaluation "2ae0e6a5"
    Evaluation triggered by job "example"
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "2ae0e6a5" finished with status "complete" but failed to place all allocations:
    Task Group "cache" (failed to place 1 allocation):
      * Class "foo" filtered 1 nodes
      * Constraint "${attr.kernel.name} = linux" filtered 1 nodes
    Evaluation "67493a64" waiting for additional capacity to place remainder
```
