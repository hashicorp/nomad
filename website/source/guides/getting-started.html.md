# Nomad Getting Started

Welcome to the Nomad guides section! If you are just getting started with 
Nomad, please start with the [Nomad introduction](/intro/getting-started/install.html) instead and then continue on to the guides. The guides provide examples of 
common Nomad workflows and actions for developers, operators, and security teams.
