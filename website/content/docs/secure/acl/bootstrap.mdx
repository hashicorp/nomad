# Bootstrap the ACL system

Bootstrapping ACLs on a new cluster requires a few steps, outlined below. For
multi-region clusters, you will perform the bootstrapping process on the
authoritative region and set up replication.

## Enable ACLs on Nomad servers

The APIs needed to manage policies and tokens are not enabled until ACLs are
enabled. To begin, you need to enable the ACLs on the servers. If a multi-region
setup is used, the authoritative region should be enabled first. For each
server:

1. Set the [`enabled` value] of the [`acl` stanza] to true. The `acl` stanza is a
   top-level stanza.

```hcl
acl {
  enabled = true
}
```

### Configure for multiple regions

For multi-region configurations, you will also need to perform additional
configuration. The regions must be joined before bootstrapping ACLs.
If the non-authoritative region was already using ACLs, any existing tokens
in that region will stop working after federation as they will be overwritten by the authoritative region.

#### Set the authoritative region

For all clusters in a multi-region setup, set the [`authoritative_region`
value] in the [`server` stanza]. Later, you'll set the [`replication_token`
value] of the [`acl` stanza]. You will learn how to generate management tokens
later in this guide.

### Reload your Nomad configuration

Take care to restart the servers one at a time and to ensure each server has
joined and is operating correctly before restarting another. You can use the
[`nomad server members` command] to verify that a server is up and ready to
handle requests.

## Bootstrap and deploy anonymous policy

Once the ACL system is enabled, you need to generate the initial token. This
first management token is used to bootstrap the system. Care should be taken not
to lose all of your management tokens. If you do, you will need to re-bootstrap
the ACL subsystem.

<Warning>

Bootstrapping the ACL subsystem will interrupt access to your
cluster. Once the [`nomad acl bootstrap` command] is run, Nomad's
default-deny policy will become enabled. You should have an acceptable anonymous
policy prepared and ready to submit immediately after bootstrapping.

</Warning>

### Stage an anonymous policy

When the ACL system is enabled, Nomad starts with a default deny-all policy. This means that by default, no permissions are granted. For clients making requests without ACL tokens, you may want to create a transitional anonymous policy to allow traffic to your cluster while you are generating and distributing tokens to your users. This is done by setting rules on the special "anonymous" policy.

<Warning>

The anonymous policy assigns permissions to all unauthenticated requests to Nomad. We recommend using tokens with specific policies rather than an overly permissive anonymous policy. This guide uses it for illustrative purposes.

</Warning>

Create a file named `anonymous.policy.hcl`, add this content to the file, and save the file. This policy allows read-only access.

```hcl
namespace "default" {
  policy       = "read"
  capabilities = ["list-jobs", "read-job"]
}

agent {
  policy = "read"
}

operator {
  policy = "read"
}

quota {
  policy = "read"
}

node {
  policy = "read"
}

host_volume "*" {
  policy = "read"
}
```

You can use this policy as a transitional anonymous policy, which will minimize time in which requests can not be submitted to the cluster once you bootstrap. Additional information is available for [node rules](/nomad/docs/other-specifications/acl-policy#node-rules), [agent rules](/nomad/docs/other-specifications/acl-policy#agent-rules), [operator rules](/nomad/docs/other-specifications/acl-policy#operator-rules), [quota rules](/nomad/docs/other-specifications/acl-policy#quota-rules), and [host volume rules](/nomad/docs/other-specifications/acl-policy#host-volume-rules).

### Run the bootstrap command

Once the ACL system is enabled, use the [`nomad acl bootstrap` command]:

```shell-session
$ nomad acl bootstrap
Accessor ID  = 5b7fd453-d3f7-6814-81dc-fcfe6daedea5
Secret ID    = 9184ec35-65d4-9258-61e3-0c066d0a45c5
Name         = Bootstrap Token
Type         = management
Global       = true
Policies     = n/a
Create Time  = 2017-09-11 17:38:10.999089612 +0000 UTC
Create Index = 7
Modify Index = 7
```

Once the initial bootstrap is performed, it cannot be performed again unless the
[reset] procedure is complete. Make sure to save this AccessorID and SecretID.
The bootstrap token is a `management` type token, meaning it can perform any
operation. It should be used to setup the ACL policies and create additional ACL
tokens. The bootstrap token can be deleted and is like any other token, care
should be taken to not revoke all management tokens.

### Provide a CLI token

If you attempt to run a command at this point without a token provided, you will
encounter an error.

```shell-session
$ nomad status
Error querying jobs: Unexpected response code: 403 (Permission denied)
```

Save the bootstrap token value to a file named `bootstrap.token`. Replace `BOOTSTRAP_SECRET_ID` in the following command with the Secret ID you received above.

```shell-session
$ echo "BOOTSTRAP_SECRET_ID" > bootstrap.token
```

Provide the token for CLI commands by setting the NOMAD_TOKEN environment variable to the bootstrap token value in the `bootstrap.token` file.

```shell-session
$ export NOMAD_TOKEN=$(cat bootstrap.token)
```

Run the [`nomad status` command]. It completes successfully because a token value is set.

```shell-session
$ nomad status
No running jobs
```

### Deploy your anonymous policy

Next, install the anonymous policy with the [`nomad acl policy apply` command].

```shell-session
$ nomad acl policy apply -description "Anonymous policy (full-access)" anonymous anonymous.policy.hcl
Successfully wrote "anonymous" ACL policy!
```

Once this command has completed, requests to the cluster that do not present a token
will use this policy.

You can also use the Nomad API to submit policies as JSON objects. Consult the
Nomad [`acl/policy` API] documentation for more information.

#### Verify anonymous requests succeed

Verify that the anonymous policy is performing as expected.

Unset your NOMAD_TOKEN environment variable to send unauthenticated requests to your cluster.

```shell-session
$ unset NOMAD_TOKEN
```

Verify that the token is unset. This command returns an empty response.

```shell-session
$ echo ${NOMAD_TOKEN}

```

Check the status. This command succeeds without a token set because the anonymous policy has permissions to read job status.

```shell-session
$ nomad status
No running jobs
```

### Delete the anonymous policy

Once you have provided your users with tokens, you can update the anonymous
policy to be more restrictive or delete it completely to deny all requests from unauthenticated users.

Delete the anonymous policy. Set the `NOMAD_TOKEN` environment variable to the bootstrap token value again. This is necessary as the `nomad acl policy delete` command [requires the management token](/nomad/commands/acl/policy/delete).

```shell-session
$ export NOMAD_TOKEN=$(cat bootstrap.token)
```

Then, delete the anonymous policy.

```shell-session
$ nomad acl policy delete anonymous
Successfully deleted anonymous policy!
```

## Enable ACLs on Nomad clients

To enforce client endpoints, you need to enable ACLs on clients as well. Do this
by setting the [`enabled` value] of the [`acl` stanza] to true. Once complete,
restart the client to read in the new configuration.

## Create management tokens for other regions

Once you have bootstrapped ACLs on the servers of the authoritative region, you
can create the replication tokens for all of the non-authoritative regions in a
multi-region configuration. These tokens must be management-type tokens since
they are used to communicate with ACL API in the authoritative region.

Create the replication token with the [`nomad acl token create` command]. Don't
forget to provide a management token via the NOMAD_TOKEN environment variable or
the `-token` flag. As practice, this time use the `-token` flag:

```shell-session
$ nomad acl token create -type="management" -global=true \
  -name="Cluster A Replication Token" \
  -token="c999c4c2-6146-1bac-eb47-3958bbffe9d8"
Accessor ID  = ec175d30-26ea-4a54-4850-45f833acece5
Secret ID    = 9e2bb5ed-b3af-6bf3-5bbc-16dc684c5c31
Name         = Cluster A Replication Token
Type         = management
Global       = true
Policies     = n/a
Create Time  = 2020-01-08 21:12:43.32324673 +0000 UTC
Create Index = 2916
Modify Index = 2916
```

## Re-bootstrap ACL system

If all management tokens are lost, it is possible to reset the ACL bootstrap so
that it can be performed again. First, you need to determine the reset index
with the bootstrap endpoint:

```shell-session
$ nomad acl bootstrap
Error bootstrapping: Unexpected response code: 500 (ACL bootstrap already done (reset index: 7))
```

The error message contains the `reset index`. To reset the ACL system, create
a file named `acl-bootstrap-reset` containing the value of the "reset index".
This file should be placed in the data directory of the leader node:

```shell-session
$ echo 7 >> /nomad-data-dir/server/acl-bootstrap-reset
```

Once the reset file is in place, you can re-bootstrap the cluster:

```shell-session
$ nomad acl bootstrap
Accessor ID  = 52d3353d-d7b9-d945-0591-1af608732b76
Secret ID    = 4b0a41ca-6d32-1853-e64b-de0d347e4525
Name         = Bootstrap Token
Type         = management
Global       = true
Policies     = n/a
Create Time  = 2017-09-11 18:38:11.929089612 +0000 UTC
Create Index = 11
Modify Index = 11
```

If you attempt to bootstrap again you will get a mismatch on the reset index:

```shell-session
$ nomad acl bootstrap

Error bootstrapping: Unexpected response code: 500 (Invalid bootstrap reset index (specified 7, reset index: 11))
```

This is because the reset file is in place, but with the former index. The reset
file can be deleted. However, if it is left behind, Nomad will not reset the
bootstrap unless the file's contents match the actual reset index.

## Access an ACL-enabled web UI

If you access the web UI without specifying an ACL token, Nomad grants you
the permissions of the anonymous policy. You can set an ACL token in the web UI
or with the CLI.

### Provide a token in the web UI

Open the web UI in your web browser with the cluster address and navigate to
the `/ui` path. Click on the user icon in the top-right of the page to open the
**Settings** page. Enter your ACL token in the **Secret ID** field and click
the **Sign in with secret** button. You can also open this page directly by
navigating to the `/ui/settings/tokens` path.

### Provide a token with the CLI

You can use the [`nomad ui` command](/nomad/commands/ui) and the token you have
set for the Nomad CLI to authenticate to the web UI. This exchanges your ACL
token for a one-time token in the web UI.

```shell-session
$ nomad ui -authenticate
Opening URL "https://127.0.0.1:4646" with one-time token
```

## Next steps

For a single cluster, the process is complete. For multi-region clusters, you
can generate tokens local to each region to scope policies to a specific
region, or use tokens with a Global scope so that you can submit jobs from any
region to any other region.

Now that you have learned about bootstrapping your Nomad cluster, you will learn
more about how to create Nomad ACL policies.
