# Command: job start

The `job start` command is used to start a stopped job.

The start command will use a Consul token with the following preference:
first the `-consul-token` flag, then the `$CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN` environment variable.
Because the consul token used to [run] the targeted job version was not
persisted, it must be provided to start if the targeted job version includes
Consul Connect enabled services and the Nomad servers were configured to require
[consul service identity] authentication.

The Start command will use a Vault token with the following preference:
first the `-vault-token` flag, then the `$VAULT_TOKEN` environment variable.
Because the vault token used to [run] the targeted job version was not
persisted, it must be provided to start if the targeted job includes
Vault policies and the Nomad servers were configured to require [vault policy]
authentication.

## Usage

```shell-session
nomad job start [options] <job>
```

The `job start` command requires one input: the job ID. Nomad will start the
latest version of the job that is not stopped. If the job has not previously
been stopped, this command will fail.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the `submit-job`
capability for the job's namespace. The `list-jobs` capability is required to
run the command with a job prefix instead of the exact job ID. The `read-job`
capability is required to monitor the resulting evaluation when `-detach` is
not used.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Start Options

- `-detach`: Return immediately instead of monitoring. A new evaluation ID
  will be output, which can be used to examine the evaluation using the
  [eval status] command.

- `-consul-token`: If set, the passed Consul token is sent along with the Start
  request to the Nomad servers. This overrides the token found in the
  `$CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN` environment variable.

- `-vault-token`: If set, the passed Vault token is sent along with the Start
  request to the Nomad servers. This overrides the token found in the
  `$VAULT_TOKEN` environment variable.

- `-verbose`: Show full information.

## Examples

Start a previously stopped job:

```shell-session
$ nomad job status
ID       Type     Priority  Status          Submit Date
example  service  50        dead (stopped)  2025-02-11T15:33:27-05:00

$ nomad job start example
==> 2025-02-11T15:34:48-05:00: Monitoring evaluation "8b715538"
    2025-02-11T15:34:48-05:00: Evaluation triggered by job "example"
    2025-02-11T15:34:49-05:00: Evaluation within deployment: "866ca498"
    2025-02-11T15:34:49-05:00: Allocation "4d050576" created: node "8e17fa4d", group "echo"
    2025-02-11T15:34:49-05:00: Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> 2025-02-11T15:34:49-05:00: Evaluation "8b715538" finished with status "complete"
