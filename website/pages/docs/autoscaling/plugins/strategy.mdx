# Strategy Plugins

Strategy plugins compare the current state of the system against the desired state
defined by the operator in the scaling policy and generate an action that will
bring the system closer to the desired state. In practical terms, strategies
receive the current value and a metric value for a resource and output what the
new value should be.

## Target Value Strategy Plugin

The target value strategy plugin will perform count calculations in order to keep
the value resulting from the APM query at or around a specified target.

### Agent Configuration Options

```hcl
strategy "target-value" {
  driver = "target-value"
}
```

### Policy Configuration Options

```hcl
check {
  ...
  strategy "target-value" {
    target    = 20
    threshold = 0.0001
  }
  ...
```

- `target` `(float: <required>)` - Specifies the metric value the Autoscaler
  should try to meet.

- `threshold` `(float: 0.01)` - Specifies how significant a change in the input
  metric should be considered. Small threshold values can lead to output
  fluctuation.

## Dynamic Application Sizing Average Strategy Plugin

~> **Enterprise Only!** This functionality only exists in Nomad Autoscaler
Enterprise. This is not present in the open source version of Nomad Autoscaler.

The `app-sizing-avg` plugin calculates the average value seen across the dataset.
The plugin applies an exponential weight decay to data, in order to give
more significance to recent data over older data.

This plugin is only recommended for CPU values of workloads with very stable
resource usage levels, such as batch jobs.

### Agent Configuration Options

The `app-sizing-avg` plugin is automatically launched by Nomad Autoscaler
Enterprise and so the following setup is optional.

```hcl
strategy "app-sizing-avg" {
  driver = "app-sizing-avg"
}
```

### Policy Configuration Options

```hcl
check "avg" {
  strategy "app-sizing-avg" {}
}
```

## Dynamic Application Sizing Max Strategy Plugin

~> **Enterprise Only!** This functionality only exists in Nomad Autoscaler
Enterprise. This is not present in the open source version of Nomad Autoscaler.

The `app-sizing-max` plugin calculates the maximum value seen for the target
resource within the available dataset. This plugin is ideally suited for memory
resources since workloads donâ€™t release their memory too often and
underprovisioning could cause OOM errors.

### Agent Configuration Options

The `app-sizing-max` plugin is automatically launched by Nomad Autoscaler
Enterprise and so the following setup is optional.

```hcl
strategy "app-sizing-max" {
  driver = "app-sizing-max"
}
```

### Policy Configuration Options

```hcl
check "max" {
  strategy "app-sizing-max" {}
}
```

## Dynamic Application Sizing Percentile Strategy Plugin

~> **Enterprise Only!** This functionality only exists in Nomad Autoscaler
Enterprise. This is not present in the open source version of Nomad Autoscaler.

The `app-sizing-percentile` plugin calculates its result based on a desired
percentile value from the dataset.

The plugin applies an exponential weight decay to data, in order to give
more significance to recent data over older data. It also adjusts its calculation
based on the amount of resources used per unit of time. This load-adjusted
calculation results in values that are more likely to actually meet the usage
needs of the workload when compared to the traditional time-based percentile
calculation.

This Dynamic Application Sizing plugin is the most versatile, since the percentile
level can be fine-tuned as needed. If your workload can withstand occasional OOM
errors gracefully, using a 98th percentile for memory instead of app-sizing-max
could result in smaller recommendations and subsequently more resource availability
for other tasks. A 95th to 90th percentile for CPU could have the same effect.

### Agent Configuration Options

The `app-sizing-percentile` plugin is automatically launched by Nomad Autoscaler
Enterprise and so the following setup is optional.

```hcl
strategy "target-value" {
  driver = "target-value"
}
```

### Policy Configuration Options

```hcl
check "p95" {
  strategy "app-sizing-percentile" {
    percentile = "95"
  }
}
```

- `percentile` `(int: 99)` - Specifies the percentile value to use when performing
  the strategy calculation.
