# Configure reschedule

Tasks can sometimes fail due to network, CPU or memory issues on the node
running the task. In such situations, Nomad can reschedule the task on another
node. The [`reschedule` stanza] can be used to configure how Nomad
should try placing failed tasks on another node in the cluster. Reschedule
attempts have a delay between each attempt, and the delay can be configured to
increase between each rescheduling attempt according to a configurable
`delay_function`. Consult the [`reschedule` stanza] documentation for more
information.

Service jobs are configured by default to have unlimited reschedule attempts.
You should use the reschedule stanza to ensure that failed tasks are
automatically reattempted on another node without needing operator intervention.

The following CLI example shows job and allocation statuses for a task being
rescheduled by Nomad. The CLI shows the number of previous attempts if there is
a limit on the number of reschedule attempts. The CLI also shows when the next
reschedule will be attempted.

```shell-session
$ nomad job status demo
ID            = demo
Name          = demo
Submit Date   = 2018-04-12T15:48:37-05:00
