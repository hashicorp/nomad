# Create and use resource quotas

[Nomad Enterprise] provides support for resource quotas, which allow operators
to restrict the aggregate resource usage of [namespaces]. Once a quota
specification is attached to a namespace, the Nomad cluster will count all
resource usage by jobs in that namespace toward the quota limits. If the
resource is exhausted, allocations within the namespaces will be queued until
resources become availableâ€”by other jobs finishing or the quota being expanded.

In this guide, you'll create a quota that limits resources in the global region.
You will then assign the quota to a namespace where you will deploy a job.
Finally, you'll learn how to secure the quota with ACLs.

<EnterpriseAlert />

## Define and create a quota

You can manage resource quotas by using the `nomad quota` subcommand. To
get started with creating a quota specification, run `nomad quota init` which
produces an example quota specification.

```shell-session
$ nomad quota init
Example quota specification written to spec.hcl
```

The file `spec.hcl` defines a limit for the global region. Additional limits may
be specified in order to limit other regions.

```hcl
# spec.hcl
name = "default-quota"
description = "Limit the shared default namespace"

# Create a limit for the global region. Additional limits may
# be specified in-order to limit other regions.
limit {
  region = "global"
  region_limit {
    cores      = 0
    cpu        = 2500
    memory     = 1000
    memory_max = 1000
    device "nvidia/gpu/1080ti" {
      count = 1
    }
  }
  variables_limit = 1000
}
```

### Resource limits

When specifying resource limits the following enforcement behaviors are defined:

- `limit < 0`: A limit less than zero disallows any access to the resource.

- `limit == 0`: A limit of zero allows unlimited access to the resource.

- `limit > 0`: A limit greater than zero enforces that the consumption is less
  than or equal to the given limit.

-> **Note:** Limits that specify the count of devices work differently. A `count > 0`
enforces that the consumption is less than or equal to the given limit, and setting
it to `0` disallows any usage of the given device. Unlike other limits, device count
cannot be set to a negative value. To allow unlimited access to a device
resource, remove it from the region limit.

A quota specification is composed of one or more resource limits. Each limit
applies to a particular Nomad region. Within the limit object, operators can
specify the allowed CPU and memory usage.

### Create the quota

To create the quota, run `nomad quota apply` with the filename of your quota specification.

```shell-session
$ nomad quota apply spec.hcl
Successfully applied quota specification "default-quota"!
```

Check for success with `nomad quota list`.

```shell-session
$ nomad quota list
Name           Description
default-quota  Limit the shared default namespace
```

## Attach a quota to a namespace

In order for a quota to be enforced, you have to attach the quota specification
to a namespace. This can be done using the `nomad namespace apply` command. Add
the new quota specification to the `default` namespace as follows:

```shell-session
$ nomad namespace apply -quota default-quota default
Successfully applied namespace "default"!
```

## View quota information

Now that you have attached a quota to a namespace, you can run a job in the default namespace.

Initialize the job.

```shell-session
$ nomad job init
Example job file written to example.nomad.hcl
```

Run the job in the default namespace.

```shell-session
$ nomad job run -detach example.nomad.hcl
Job registration successful
Evaluation ID: 985a1df8-0221-b891-5dc1-4d31ad4e2dc3
```

Check the status.

```shell-session
$ nomad quota status default-quota
Name        = default-quota
Description = Limit the shared default namespace
Limits      = 1

Quota Limits
Region  CPU Usage  Core Usage  Memory Usage  Memory Max Usage  Variables Usage
global  0 / 2500   0 / inf     0 / 1000      0 / 1000          0 / 1000

Quota Device Limits
Region  Device Name        Device Usage
global  nvidia/gpu/1080ti  1 / 1
```

Notice that the newly created job is accounted against the quota specification
since it is being run in the namespace attached to the "default-quota" quota.

```shell-session
$ nomad job run -detach example.nomad.hcl
Job registration successful
Evaluation ID: ce8e1941-0189-b866-3dc4-7cd92dc38a69
```

Now, add more instances of the job by changing `count = 1` to `count = 4` and
check to see if additional allocations were added.

```shell-session
$ nomad status example
ID            = example
Name          = example
Submit Date   = 10/16/17 10:51:32 PDT
Type          = service
Priority      = 50
Datacenters   = dc1
Status        = running
Periodic      = false
Parameterized = false

Summary
Task Group  Queued  Starting  Running  Failed  Complete  Lost
cache       1       0         3        0       0         0

  * Quota limit hit "memory exhausted (1024 needed > 1000 limit)"

ce8e1941  81f72d90  cache       1        run      running  10/16/17 10:51:32 PDT
9b8e185e  81f72d90  cache       1        run      running  10/16/17 10:51:24 PDT
```

The output indicates that Nomad created two more allocations but did not place
the fourth allocation, which would have caused the quota to be oversubscribed on
memory.

## Secure quota with ACLs

Access to quotas can be restricted using [ACLs]. As an example, you could create
an ACL policy that allows read-only access to quotas.

```hcl
# Allow read only access to quotas.
quota {
    policy = "read"
}
```

Proper ACLs are necessary to prevent users from bypassing quota enforcement by
increasing or removing the quota specification.

## Design for federated clusters

Nomad makes working with quotas in a federated cluster simple by replicating
quota specifications from the [authoritative Nomad region]. This allows
operators to interact with a single cluster but create quota specifications that
apply to all Nomad clusters.

As an example, you can create a quota specification that applies to two regions:

```hcl
name = "federated-example"
description = "A single quota spec affecting multiple regions"

# Create a limits for two regions
limit {
    region = "europe"
    region_limit {
        cpu = 20000
        memory = 10000
    }
}

limit {
    region = "asia"
    region_limit {
        cpu = 10000
        memory = 5000
    }
}
```

Apply the specification.

```shell-session
$ nomad quota apply spec.hcl
Successfully applied quota specification "federated-example"!
```

Now that the specification is applied and attached to a namespace with jobs in each region,
use the `nomad quota status` command to observe how the enforcement applies
across federated clusters.

```shell-session
$ nomad quota status federated-example
Name        = federated-example
Description = A single quota spec affecting multiple regions
Limits      = 2

Quota Limits
Region  CPU Usage     Memory Usage
asia    2500 / 10000  1000 / 5000
europe  8800 / 20000  6000 / 10000
```
