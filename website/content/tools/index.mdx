installed separately from Nomad itself and can sometimes be deployed as a Nomad
job in your cluster.

The following external tools are currently available for Nomad and maintained by HashiCorp:

- [Autoscaling](/nomad/tools/autoscaling) - HashiCorp's official Nomad Autoscaler. Supports scaling allocations within Nomad and scaling nodes on AWS, Azure, GCP, or arbitrary infrastructure via plugins.
- [Damon](https://github.com/hashicorp/damon) - A terminal dashboard for Nomad.
- [Levant](https://github.com/hashicorp/levant) - A templating and deployment tool for HashiCorp Nomad jobs that provides realtime feedback and detailed failure messages upon deployment issues.
