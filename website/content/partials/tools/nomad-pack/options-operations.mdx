### Operation options

- `-var-file=<string>`: Specifies the path to a variable override file. This can
						be provided multiple times on a single command to result
						in a list of files.
- `-allow-unset-vars`: Suppress errors from unset variables without default
					values. Equivalent of setting the NOMAD_PACK_ALLOW_UNSET_VARS
					environment variable to "1" or "true".
- `-ignore-missing-vars`: Determines whether override variables not present in
					the pack should be ignored or produce an error.
- `-var=<key=value>`: Specifies single override variables in the form of HCL
					syntax and can be specified multiple times per command.
- `-name=<string>`: If set, this will be the unique identifier of this deployed
					instance of the specified pack. If not set, the pack name will be
					used. This is useful for running more than one instance of a pack
					within the same cluster. Note that this name must be globally unique
					within a cluster. Running the run command multiple times with the same
					name, will just re-submit the same pack, and apply changes if you have
					made any to the underlying pack. Be mindful that, whether you have
					made changes or not, the underlying Allocations will be replaced. When
					managing packs, the name specified here is the name that should be
					passed to nomad-pack's plan and destroy commands.
- `-parser-v1`: Use the legacy syntax parser to parse your job. This
			enables pack to run packs for earlier versions while you are
			migrating them to the new syntax
