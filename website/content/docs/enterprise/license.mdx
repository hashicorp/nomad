## Nomad Enterprise Licensing

Licensing capabilities were added to Nomad Enterprise v0.12.0. Each server in
the cluster must have its own license. Nomad Enterprise can be downloaded from
the [releases site].

Click [here](https://www.hashicorp.com/go/nomad-enterprise) to set up a demo of Nomad Enterprise
or [here](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/nomad/trial) to get a trial license.

~> **Note:** A Nomad Enterprise cluster cannot be downgraded to the open
source version of Nomad. Servers running the open source version of Nomad will
panic if they are joined to a Nomad Enterprise cluster. See issue [gh-9958]
for more details.

## Expiring Licenses

a server with the `nomad license get` command:

As a Nomad Enterprise license approaches its expiration time, Nomad servers
will periodically log a warning message about the approaching
expiration. Below shows log excerpts of the warnings.

```
    2021-03-29T15:02:28.100-0400 [WARN]  nomad.licensing: license expiring: time_left=5m0s
    2021-03-29T15:03:28.103-0400 [WARN]  nomad.licensing: license expiring: time_left=4m0s
    2021-03-29T15:04:28.106-0400 [WARN]  nomad.licensing: license expiring: time_left=3m0s
    2021-03-29T15:05:28.109-0400 [WARN]  nomad.licensing: license expiring: time_left=2m0s
    2021-03-29T15:06:28.112-0400 [WARN]  nomad.licensing: license expiring: time_left=1m0s
    2021-03-29T15:07:28.114-0400 [WARN]  nomad.licensing: license expiring: time_left=0s
    2021-03-29T15:07:58.104-0400 [ERROR] nomad.licensing: license expired, please update license: error="invalid license or license is expired"
```

When the license expires, enterprise functionality will become limited. Only
read operations on enterprise endpoints will be supported, and write
operations will return an error.

Note that if the server is restarted with an expired license, it will
immediately stop.

## Configuring the License

See the server [license configuration] reference documentation on all the
options to set an enterprise license. Nomad will load the license file from
disk or environment when it starts.

In order to immediately alert operators of a bad configuration setting, if a
license configuration option is an invalid or expired license, the Nomad server
will exit with an error.

```
NOMAD_LICENSE=misconfigured nomad agent -dev
==> No configuration files loaded
==> Starting Nomad agent...
==> Error starting agent: server setup failed: failed to initialize enterprise licensing: a file license was configured but the license is invalid: error decoding version: expected integer
```

See the [License commands](/docs/commands/license) for more information on
interacting with the Enterprise License.
