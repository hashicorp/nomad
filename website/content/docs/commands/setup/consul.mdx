  Setup a Consul cluster for Nomad integration.

# Command: setup consul

This command sets up Consul for allowing Nomad workloads to authenticate
themselves using Workload Identity.

This command requires `acl:write` permissions for Consul and respects
`CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN`, `CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR`, and other [Consul-related environment
variables][consulenv].

<Warning>

This command is an experimental feature and may change its behavior in future
versions of Nomad.

</Warning>

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad setup consul [options]
```

## General Options

@include 'general_options_no_namespace.mdx'

## Setup Consul Options

- `-jwks-url`: URL of Nomad's JWKS endpoint contacted by Consul to verify JWT
  signatures. Defaults to `http://localhost:4646/.well-known/jwks.json`.

- `-cleanup`: Removes all configuration components this command created from the
  Consul cluster.

- `-y`: Automatically answers "yes" to all the questions, making the setup
  non-interactive. Defaults to "false".

## Examples

Below is an example of an interactive session with default options, interrupted
by answering "no" to one of the questions, demonstrating the helper's "cleanup"
capabilities as well.

```shell-session
$ nomad setup consul

This command will walk you through configuring all the components required for
Nomad workloads to authenticate themselves against Consul ACL using their
respective workload identities.

First we need to connect to Consul.

[?] Is "127.0.0.1:8500" the correct address of your Consul cluster? [Y/n]

Since you're running Consul Enterprise, we will additionally create
a namespace "nomad-workloads" and bind the auth methods to that namespace.

[?] Create the namespace "nomad-workloads" in your Consul cluster? [Y/n]
[✔] Created namespace "nomad-workloads".

Nomad needs a JWT auth method for Consul services and tasks. The method for
services will be called "nomad-workloads".

This is the "nomad-workloads" method configuration:

{
    "Name": "nomad-workloads",
    "Type": "jwt",
    "DisplayName": "nomad-workloads",
    "Description": "Login method for Nomad workloads using workload identities",
    "TokenLocality": "local",
    "Config": {
        "BoundAudiences": [
            "consul.io"
        ],
        "ClaimMappings": {
            "consul_namespace": "consul_namespace",
            "nomad_job_id": "nomad_job_id",
            "nomad_namespace": "nomad_namespace",
            "nomad_service": "nomad_service",
            "nomad_task": "nomad_task"
        },
        "JWKSURL": "http://localhost:4646/.well-known/jwks.json",
        "JWTSupportedAlgs": [
            "RS256"
        ]
    },
    "CreateIndex": 0,
    "ModifyIndex": 0,
    "NamespaceRules": [
        {
            "BindNamespace": "${value.consul_namespace}"
        }
    ]
}
[?] Create "nomad-workloads" auth method in your Consul cluster? [Y/n]
[✔] Created auth method "nomad-workloads".

Consul uses binding rules to map claims between Nomad's JWTs to Consul service
identities and ACL roles, so we need to create a two binding rules for the auth
method we created above: one for services, and one for tasks.

This is the binding rule for services:

{
    "ID": "",
    "Description": "Binding rule for Nomad services authenticated using a workload identity",
    "AuthMethod": "nomad-workloads",
    "Selector": "\"nomad_service\" in value",
    "BindType": "service",
    "BindName": "${value.nomad_service}",
    "CreateIndex": 0,
    "ModifyIndex": 0
}
[?] Create this binding rule in your Consul cluster? [Y/n]
[✔] Created binding rule for auth method "nomad-workloads".

This is the binding rule for tasks:

{
    "ID": "",
    "Description": "Binding rule for Nomad tasks authenticated using a workload identity",
    "AuthMethod": "nomad-workloads",
    "Selector": "\"nomad_service\" not in value",
    "BindType": "role",
    "BindName": "nomad-${value.nomad_namespace}-tasks",
    "CreateIndex": 0,
    "ModifyIndex": 0
}
[?] Create this binding rule in your Consul cluster? [Y/n] n

By answering "no" to any of these questions, you are risking an incorrect Consul
cluster configuration. Nomad workloads with Workload Identity will not be able
to authenticate unless you create missing configuration yourself.

[?] Remove everything this command creates? [Y/n]
The following items will be deleted:
  * Auth method: nomad-workloads
  * Binding rules: 4d80108a-6d77-36e1-71b1-d20a9acf8b17
  * Namespace: nomad-workloads

[?] Remove all the items listed above? [Y/n]
[✔] Deleted binding rule "4d80108a-6d77-36e1-71b1-d20a9acf8b17".
[✔] Deleted auth method "nomad-workloads".
[✔] Deleted namespace "nomad-workloads".

Consul cluster has not been configured for authenticating Nomad tasks and
services using workload identitiies.

Run the command again to finish the configuration process.
