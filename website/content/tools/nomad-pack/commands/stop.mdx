# nomad-pack stop command reference

Stop the specified Nomad Pack in the configured Nomad cluster.

By default, the stop command stops all jobs in the pack deployment. If you ran a
pack with variable overrides to specify the job name, you must provide the same
variable overrides when stopping the pack to guarantee that this command targets
the correct job in the pack deployment.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad-pack stop <pack_name> [options]
```

To delete the pack from the cluster, specify `--purge`, or use the [`nomad-pack
destroy` command](/nomad/tools/nomad-pack/commands/destroy).

## Options

- `-registry=<string>`: Specific registry name containing the pack to be stopped.
- `-ref=<string>`: Specific Git reference of the pack to be stopped.
					Supports tags, SHA, and latest. If no ref is specified,
					defaults to latest.	Using `ref` with a file path is not supported.
- `-purge`: Purge is used to stop packs and purge them from the system.
					If not set, packs will still be queryable and will be purged
					by the garbage collector.
- `-global`: Stop multi-region pack in all its regions. By default, pack
					stop will stop only a single region at a time. Ignored for
					single-region jobs.

```

Stop an example pack in deployment "dev" that has a job named "test"
