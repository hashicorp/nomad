# `csi_plugin` Stanza

<Placement groups={['job', 'group', 'task', 'volume']} />

The "csi_plugin" stanza allows the task to specify it provides a
Container Storage Interface plugin to the cluster. Nomad will
automatically register the plugin so that it can be used by other jobs
to claim [volumes][csi_volumes].

```hcl
csi_plugin {
  id        = "csi-hostpath"
  type      = "monolith"
  mount_dir = "/csi"
}
```

## `csi_plugin` Parameters

- `id` `(string: <required>)` - This is the ID for the plugin. Some
  plugins will require both controller and node plugin types (see
  below); you need to use the same ID for both so that Nomad knows the
  belong to the same plugin.

- `type` `(string: <required>)` - One of `node`, `controller`, or
  `monolith`. Each plugin supports one or more types. Each Nomad
  client node where you want to mount a volume will need a `node`
  plugin instance. Some plugins will also require one or more
  `controller` plugin instances to communicate with the storage
  provider's APIs. Some plugins can serve as both `controller` and
  `node` at the same time, and these are called `monolith`
  plugins. Refer to your CSI plugin's documentation.

- `mount_dir` `(string: <required>)` - The directory path inside the
  container where the plugin will expect a Unix domain socket for
  bidirectional communication with Nomad.


~> **Note:** Plugins running as `node` or `monolith` require root
privileges (or `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` on Linux) to mount volumes on the
host. With the Docker task driver, you can use the `privileged = true`
configuration, but no other default task drivers currently have this
option.

~> **Note:** During node drains, jobs that claim volumes must be moved before
the `node` or `monolith` plugin for those volumes. You should run `node` or
`monolith` plugins as [`system`][system] jobs and use the `-ignore-system`
flag on `nomad node drain` to ensure that the plugins are running while the
node is being drained.

## `csi_plugin` Examples

```hcl
job "plugin-efs" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]

  # you can run node plugins as service jobs as well, but running
  # as a system job ensures all nodes in the DC have a copy.
  type = "system"

  group "nodes" {
    task "plugin" {
      driver = "docker"

      config {
        image = "amazon/aws-efs-csi-driver:latest"

        args = [
          "node",
          "--endpoint=unix://csi/csi.sock",
          "--logtostderr",
          "--v=5",
        ]

        # all CSI node plugins will need to run as privileged tasks
        # so they can mount volumes to the host. controller plugins
        # do not need to be privileged.
        privileged = true
      }

      csi_plugin {
        id        = "aws-efs0"
        type      = "node"
        mount_dir = "/csi"  # this path /csi matches the --endpoint
                            # argument for the container
      }
    }
  }
}
```
