### Operation options

- `-var-file=<string>`: Specifies the path to a variable override file. You may
  provide this multiple times on a single command for multiple files.
- `-allow-unset-vars`: Suppress errors from unset variables without default
  values. Equivalent of setting the NOMAD_PACK_ALLOW_UNSET_VARS	environment
  variable to `1` or `true`.
- `-ignore-missing-vars`: Determines whether the command should override
  variables not present in the pack or should produce an error.
- `-var=<key=value>`: Specifies single override variables in the form of HCL
  syntax. You may specify multiple times per command.
- `-name=<string>`: If set, this is the unique identifier of this deployed
  instance of the specified pack. If not set, the pack name becomes the	unique
  identifier. Setting a name is useful for running more than one	instance of a
  pack	within the same cluster. Note that this name must	be globally unique
  within a cluster. Running the run command multiple	times with the same	name
  re-submits the same pack and applies changes if you have	made any to the
  underlying pack. Be mindful that, whether	you have made changes or not, the
  underlying allocations are replaced.When	managing packs, the name specified
  here is the name that you should be	pass to Nomad Packs' `plan` and `destroy`
  commands.
- `-parser-v1`: Use the legacy syntax parser to parse your job. This enables
  pack to run packs for earlier versions while you are	migrating them to the
  new syntax
