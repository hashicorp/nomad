# Command: job run

**Alias: `nomad run`**

The `job run` command is used to submit new jobs to Nomad or to update existing
jobs. Job files must conform to the [job specification] format.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad job run [options] <job file>
```

The `job run` command requires a single argument, specifying the path to a file
containing a valid [job specification]. This file will be read and the job will
be submitted to Nomad for scheduling. If the supplied path is "-", the job file
is read from STDIN. Otherwise it is read from the file at the supplied path or
downloaded and read from URL specified. Nomad downloads the job file using
[`go-getter`] and supports `go-getter` syntax.

By default, on successful job submission the run command will enter an
interactive monitor and display log information detailing the scheduling
decisions, placement information, and [deployment status] for the provided job
if applicable ([`batch`] and [`system`] jobs don't create deployments). The monitor will
exit after scheduling and deployment have finished or failed.

On successful job submission and scheduling, exit code 0 will be returned. If
there are job placement issues encountered (unsatisfiable constraints, resource
exhaustion, etc), then the exit code will be 2. Any other errors, including
deployment failures, client connection issues, or internal errors, are indicated
by exit code 1.

If the job has specified the region, the `-region` flag and `$NOMAD_REGION`
environment variable are overridden and the job's region is used.

The run command will set the `consul_token` of the job based on the following
precedence, going from highest to lowest: the `-consul-token` flag, the
`$CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN` environment variable and finally the value in the job file.

The run command will set the `vault_token` of the job based on the following
precedence, going from highest to lowest: the `-vault-token` flag, the
`$VAULT_TOKEN` environment variable and finally the value in the job file.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the `submit-job`
capability for the job's namespace. Jobs that mount CSI volumes require a
token with the `csi-mount-volume` capability for the volume's namespace. Jobs
that mount host volumes require a token with the `host_volume` capability for
that volume.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Run Options

- `-check-index`: If set, the job is only registered or
  updated if the passed job modify index matches the server side version.
  If a check-index value of zero is passed, the job is only registered if it does
  not yet exist. If a non-zero value is passed, it ensures that the job is being
  updated from a known state. The use of this flag is most common in conjunction
  with [`job plan` command].

- `-detach`: Return immediately instead of monitoring. A new evaluation ID
  will be output, which can be used to examine the evaluation using the
  [eval status] command.

- `-eval-priority`: Override the priority of the evaluations produced as a result
  of this job submission. By default, this is set to the priority of the job.

- `-hcl1`: If set, HCL1 parser is used for parsing the job spec.

- `-hcl2-strict`: Whether an error should be produced from the HCL2 parser where
  a variable has been supplied which is not defined within the root variables.
  Defaults to true.

- `-output`: Output the JSON that would be submitted to the HTTP API without
  submitting the job.

- `-policy-override`: Sets the flag to force override any soft mandatory
  Sentinel policies.

- `-preserve-counts`: If set, the existing task group counts will be preserved
  when updating a job.

- `-consul-token`: If set, the passed Consul token is stored in the job before
  sending to the Nomad servers. This allows passing the Consul token without
  storing it in the job file. This overrides the token found in the
  `$CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN` environment variable and that found in the job.

- `-consul-namespace`: <EnterpriseAlert inline/> If set, any services in the job will be registered into the
  specified Consul namespace. Any `template` stanza reading from Consul KV will
  scoped to the the specified Consul namespace. If Consul ACLs are enabled and the
  [`allow_unauthenticated`] Nomad server Consul configuration is not enabled, then
  a Consul token must be supplied with appropriate service and kv Consul ACL policy
  permissions.

- `-vault-token`: If set, the passed Vault token is stored in the job before
  sending to the Nomad servers. This allows passing the Vault token without
  storing it in the job file. This overrides the token found in the
  `$VAULT_TOKEN` environment variable and that found in the job.

- `-vault-namespace`: If set, the passed Vault namespace is stored in the job
  before sending to the Nomad servers.

- `-var=<key=value>`: Variable for template, can be used multiple times.

- `-var-file=<path>`: Path to HCL2 file containing user variables.

- `-verbose`: Show full information.

## Examples

Schedule the job contained in the file `job1.nomad`, monitoring placement and deployment:
