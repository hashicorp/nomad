# Command: job stop

**Alias: `nomad stop`**

The `job stop` command is used to stop a running job and signals the scheduler
to cancel all the running allocations.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad job stop [options] <job 1> <job 2> ... <job N>
```

The `job stop` command requires at least one job ID or prefix to stop. If there
is an exact match based on the provided job ID or prefix, then the job will be
cancelled. Otherwise, a list of matching jobs and information will be
displayed.

Stop will issue a request to deregister the matched jobs and then invoke an
interactive monitor that exits automatically once the scheduler has processed
the requests. It is safe to exit the monitor early using ctrl+c.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the `submit-job`,
`read-job`, and `list-jobs` capabilities for the job's namespace.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Stop Options

- `-detach`: Return immediately instead of entering monitor mode. After the
  deregister command is submitted, a new evaluation ID is printed to the screen,
  which can be used to examine the evaluation using the [eval status] command.

- `-eval-priority`: Override the priority of the evaluations produced as a result
  of this job deregistration. By default, this is set to the priority of the job.

- `-verbose`: Show full information.

- `-yes`: Automatic yes to prompts.

- `-purge`: Purge is used to stop the job and purge it from the system. If not
  set, the job will still be queryable and will be purged by the garbage
  collector.

- `-global`
  Stop a [multi-region] job in all its regions. By default, `job stop` will
  stop only a single region at a time. Ignored for single-region jobs.

- `-no-shutdown-delay`
  Ignore the group and task [`shutdown_delay`] configuration so that
  there is no delay between service deregistration and task
  shutdown. Note that using this flag will result in failed network
  connections to the allocations being stopped.

## Examples

Stop the job with ID "job1":

```shell-session
$ nomad job stop job1
==> Monitoring evaluation "43bfe672"
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "43bfe672" finished with status "complete"
```

Stop multiple jobs:

```shell-session
$ nomad job stop job1 job2
==> 2022-12-16T15:19:28-08:00: Monitoring evaluation "166c39c5"
==> 2022-12-16T15:19:28-08:00: Monitoring evaluation "049404c2"
