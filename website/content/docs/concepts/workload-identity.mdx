# Workload Identity

When an [allocation] is accepted by the [plan applier], the leader
generates a Workload Identity for each task in the allocation. This
workload identity is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that has been signed by
the leader's keyring. The workload identity includes the following
identity claims:

```json
{
  "nomad_namespace": "default",
  "nomad_job_id": "example",
  "nomad_allocation_id": "5c6328f7-48c5-4d03-bada-91ef2e904d0d",
  "nomad_task": "web"
}
```

## Implicit Access to ACL Policies

Nomad implicitly attaches a set of ACL policies to every workload
identity. The names of these policies start with the Nomad-owned
prefix `_:`, followed by the namespace, job ID, task group name, and
task name.

```
_:/$namespace/$job_id/$task_group/$task
_:/$namespace/$job_id/$task_group
_:/$namespace/$job_id
_:/$namespace
```

For example, the task created by the example job spec created with
`nomad job init -short` will have the following policies:

```
_:/default/example/cache/redis
_:/default/example/cache
_:/default/example
_:/default
```

If these policies don't exist, the workload identity doesn't have any
additional capabilities. But you can create a policy with one of these
names and the task will automatically have access to them. For
example, to give the task above access to set of shared secrets, you
can create the following policy file:

```hcl
namespace "shared" {
  secure_variables {
    path "*" {
      capabilities = ["read"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then create the policy with `nomad acl policy apply
"_:/default/example/cache/redis" ./policy.hcl` to give the task read
access to all paths in the "shared" namespace.

## Using Workload Identity

In Nomad 1.4.0 the workload identity is used only for `template`
access to [Secure Variables] and not exposed outside of Nomad. Future
versions of Nomad will make the workload identity available for
verification outside of Nomad.
