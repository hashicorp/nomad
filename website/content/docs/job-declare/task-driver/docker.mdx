# Use the Docker task driver in a job

Name: `docker`

The `docker` driver provides a first-class Docker workflow on Nomad. The Docker
driver handles downloading containers, mapping ports, and starting, watching,
and cleaning up after containers.

**Note:** If you are using Docker Desktop for Windows or MacOS, check
[the FAQ][faq-win-mac].

Refer to [Configure the Docker task
driver](/nomad/docs/deploy/task-driver/docker) for capabilities, client
requirements, and plugin configuration.

## Task Configuration

```hcl
task "webservice" {
  driver = "docker"

  config {
    image = "redis:7"
    labels = {
      group = "webservice-cache"
    }
  }
}
```

The `docker` driver supports the following configuration in the job spec. Only
`image` is required.

- `image` - The Docker image to run. The image may include a tag or custom URL
  and should include `https://` if required. By default it will be fetched from
  Docker Hub. If the tag is omitted or equal to `latest` the driver will always
  try to pull the image. If the image to be pulled exists in a registry that
  requires authentication credentials must be provided to Nomad.

  ```hcl
  config {
    image = "https://hub.docker.internal/redis:7"
  }
  ```

- `image_pull_timeout` - (Optional) A time duration that controls how long Nomad
  will wait before cancelling an in-progress pull of the Docker image as specified
  in `image`. Defaults to `"5m"`.

- `args` - (Optional) A list of arguments to the optional `command`. If no
  `command` is specified, the arguments are passed directly to the container.
  References to environment variables or any [interpretable Nomad
  variables](/nomad/docs/reference/runtime-variable-interpolation) will be interpreted before
  launching the task. For example:

  ```hcl
  config {
    args = [
      "-bind", "${NOMAD_PORT_http}",
      "${nomad.datacenter}",
      "${MY_ENV}",
      "${meta.foo}",
    ]
  }
  ```

- `auth` - (Optional) Provide authentication for a private registry (see below).

- `auth_soft_fail` `(bool: false)` - Don't fail the task on an auth failure.
  Attempt to continue without auth. If the Nomad client configuration has an
  [`auth.helper`](/nomad/docs/deploy/task-driver/docker#helper) block, the helper will be tried for
  all images, including public images. If you mix private and public images,
  you will need to include `auth_soft_fail=true` in every job using a public
  image.

- `command` - (Optional) The command to run when starting the container.

  ```hcl
  config {
    command = "my-command"
  }
  ```

- `cgroupns` - (Optional) Cgroup namespace to use. Set to `host` or
  `private`. If not specified, the driver uses Docker's default. Refer to Docker's [dockerd reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/dockerd/) for more information.

- `container_exists_attempts` - (Optional) A number of attempts to be made to
  purge a container if during task creation Nomad encounters an existing one in
  non-running state for the same task. Defaults to `5`.

- `dns_search_domains` - (Optional) A list of DNS search domains for
  the container to use. If you are using bridge networking mode with a
  `network` block in the task group, you must set all DNS options in
  the `network.dns` block instead.

- `dns_options` - (Optional) A list of DNS options for the container
  to use. If you are using bridge networking mode with a `network`
  block in the task group, you must set all DNS options in the
  `network.dns` block instead.

- `dns_servers` - (Optional) A list of DNS servers for the container
  to use (e.g. ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"]). Requires Docker v1.10 or
  greater. If you are using bridge networking mode with a `network`
  block in the task group, you must set all DNS options in the
  `network.dns` block instead.

- `entrypoint` - (Optional) A string list overriding the image's entrypoint.

- `extra_hosts` - (Optional) A list of hosts, given as host:IP, to be added to
  `/etc/hosts`. This option may not work as expected in `bridge` network mode
  when there is more than one task within the same group. Refer to the
  [upgrade guide][upgrade_guide_extra_hosts] for more information.

- `force_pull` - (Optional) `true` or `false` (default). Always pull most recent image
  instead of using existing local image. Should be set to `true` if repository tags
  are mutable. If image's tag is `latest` or omitted, the image will always be pulled
  regardless of this setting.

- `group_add` - (Optional) A list of supplementary groups to be applied
  to the container user.

- `healthchecks` - (Optional) A configuration block for controlling how the
  docker driver manages HEALTHCHECK directives built into the container. Set
  `healthchecks.disable` to disable any built-in healthcheck.

  ```hcl
  config {
    healthchecks {
      disable = true
    }
  }
  ```

- `hostname` - (Optional) The hostname to assign to the container. When
  launching more than one of a task (using `count`) with this option set, every
  container the task starts will have the same hostname.

- `init` - (Optional) `true` or `false` (default). Enable init (tini) system when
   launching your container. When enabled, an init process will be used as the PID1
   in the container. Specifying an init process ensures the usual responsibilities
   of an init system, such as reaping zombie processes, are performed inside the
   created container.

   The default init process used is the first `docker-init` executable found in the
   system path of the Docker daemon process. This `docker-init` binary, included in
   the default installation, is backed by [tini][tini].

- `interactive` - (Optional) `true` or `false` (default). Keep STDIN open on
  the container.

- `isolation` - (Optional) Specifies [Windows isolation][] mode: `"hyperv"` or
  `"process"`. Defaults to `"hyperv"`.


- `sysctl` - (Optional) A key-value map of sysctl configurations to set to the
  containers on start.

  ```hcl
  config {
    sysctl = {
      "net.core.somaxconn" = "16384"
    }
  }
  ```

   <Warning>

   If you are creating your job specification in JSON, you must use wrap the map in an
   array. Do not use a bare map as you would in HCL.

   ```json
   config {
     "sysctl": [
      {
       "net.core.somaxconn": "16384",
       "net.ipv4.tw_reuse": "1"
      }
    ]
   }
   ```

   </Warning>

- `ulimit` - (Optional) A key-value map of ulimit configurations to set to the
  containers on start.

  ```hcl
  config {
    ulimit {
      nproc = "4242"
      nofile = "2048:4096"
    }
  }
  ```

- `privileged` - (Optional) `true` or `false` (default). Privileged mode gives
  the container access to devices on the host. Note that this also requires the
  nomad agent and docker daemon to be configured to allow privileged
  containers.

- `ipc_mode` - (Optional) The IPC mode to be used for the container. The default
  is `none` for a private IPC namespace. Other values are `host` for sharing
  the host IPC namespace or the name or id of an existing container. Note that
  it is not possible to refer to Docker containers started by Nomad since their
  names are not known in advance. Note that setting this option also requires the
  Nomad agent to be configured to allow privileged containers.

- `ipv4_address` - (Optional) The IPv4 address to be used for the container when
  using user defined networks. Requires Docker 1.13 or greater.

- `ipv6_address` - (Optional) The IPv6 address to be used for the container when
  using user defined networks. Requires Docker 1.13 or greater.

- `labels` - (Optional) A key-value map of labels to set to the containers on
  start.

  ```hcl
  config {
    labels = {
      foo = "bar"
      "quote.dotted.keys" = "zap"
    }
  }
  ```

- `load` - (Optional) Load an image from a `tar` archive file instead of from a
  remote repository. Equivalent to the `docker load -i <filename>` command. If
  you're using an `artifact` block to fetch the archive file, you'll need to
  ensure that Nomad keeps the archive intact after download.

  ```hcl
  artifact {
    source = "http://path.to/redis.tar"
    options {
      archive = false
    }
  }
  config {
    load = "redis.tar"
    image = "redis"
  }
  ```

- `logging` - (Optional) A key-value map of Docker logging options.
  Defaults to `json-file` with log rotation (`max-file=2` and `max-size=2m`).

  ```hcl
  config {
    logging {
      type = "fluentd"
      config {
        fluentd-address = "localhost:24224"
        tag = "your_tag"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- `mac_address` - (Optional) The MAC address for the container to use (e.g.
  "02:68:b3:29:da:98").

- `memory_hard_limit` - (Optional) The maximum allowable amount of memory used
  (megabytes) by the container. If set, the [`memory`](/nomad/docs/job-specification/resources#memory)
  parameter of the task resource configuration becomes a soft limit passed to the
  docker driver as [`--memory_reservation`](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#limit-a-containers-access-to-memory),
  and `memory_hard_limit` is passed as the [`--memory`](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#limit-a-containers-access-to-memory)
  hard limit. When the host is under memory pressure, the behavior of soft limit
  activation is governed by the [Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroup-v1/memory.txt).

- `network_aliases` - (Optional) A list of network-scoped aliases, provide a way for a
  container to be discovered by an alternate name by any other container within
  the scope of a particular network. Network-scoped alias is supported only for
  containers in user defined networks

  ```hcl
  config {
    network_mode = "user-network"
    network_aliases = [
      "${NOMAD_TASK_NAME}",
      "${NOMAD_TASK_NAME}-${NOMAD_ALLOC_INDEX}"
    ]
  }
  ```

- `network_mode` - (Optional) The network mode to be used for the container. In
  order to support userspace networking plugins in Docker 1.9 this accepts any
  value. The default is `bridge` for all operating systems but Windows, which
  defaults to `nat`. Other networking modes may not work without additional
  configuration on the host (which is outside the scope of Nomad). Valid values
  pre-docker 1.9 are `default`, `bridge`, `host`, `none`, or `container:name`.

  The default `network_mode` for tasks that use group networking in [`bridge`]
  mode will be `container:<name>`, where the name is the container name of the
  parent container used to share network namespaces between tasks. If you set
  the group [`network.mode`][] to `"bridge"` you should not set this Docker
  `network_mode` config, otherwise the container will be unable to reach other
  containers in the task group. This will also prevent [Connect]-enabled tasks
  from reaching the Envoy sidecar proxy. You must also set any DNS options in
  the `network.dns` block and not in the task configuration.

  If you are in the process of migrating from the default Docker network to
  group-wide bridge networking, you may encounter issues preventing your
  containers from reaching networks outside of the bridge interface on systems with
  firewalld enabled. This behavior is often caused by the CNI plugin not registering the group
  network as trusted and can be resolved as described in the [network block] documentation.

- `oom_score_adj` - (Optional) A positive integer to indicate the likelihood of
  the task being OOM killed (valid only for Linux). Defaults to 0.

- `pid_mode` - (Optional) `host` or not set (default). Set to `host` to share
  the PID namespace with the host. Note that this also requires the Nomad agent
  to be configured to allow privileged containers.
  See below for more details.

- `ports` - (Optional) A list of port labels to map into the container (see below).

- `port_map` - (Optional) _Deprecated_ A key-value map of port labels (see below).

- `security_opt` - (Optional) A list of string flags to pass directly to
  [`--security-opt`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).
  For example:

  ```hcl
  config {
    security_opt = [
      "credentialspec=file://gmsaUser.json",
    ]
  }
  ```

- `shm_size` - (Optional) The size (bytes) of /dev/shm for the container.

- `storage_opt` - (Optional) A key-value map of storage options set to the containers on start.
  This overrides the [host dockerd configuration](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#options-per-storage-driver).
  For example:

  ```hcl
  config {
    storage_opt = {
      size = "40G"
    }
  }
  ```

- `tty` - (Optional) `true` or `false` (default). Allocate a pseudo-TTY for the
  container.

- `uts_mode` - (Optional) `host` or not set (default). Set to `host` to share
  the UTS namespace with the host. Note that this also requires the Nomad agent
  to be configured to allow privileged containers.

- `userns_mode` - (Optional) `host` or not set (default). Set to `host` to use
  the host's user namespace (effectively disabling user namespacing) when user
  namespace remapping is enabled on the docker daemon. This field has no
  effect if the docker daemon does not have user namespace remapping enabled.

- `volumes` - (Optional) A list of `host_path:container_path` strings to bind
  host paths to container paths. Mounting host paths outside of the [allocation
  working directory] is prevented by default and limits volumes to directories
  that exist inside the allocation working directory. You can allow mounting
  host paths outside of the [allocation working directory] on individual clients
  by setting the `docker.volumes.enabled` option to `true` in the
  [client's configuration](/nomad/docs/deploy/task-driver/docker#client-requirements). We recommend using
  [`mount`](#mount) if you wish to have more control over volume definitions.

  ```hcl
  config {
    volumes = [
      # Use absolute paths to mount arbitrary paths on the host
      "/path/on/host:/path/in/container",

      # Use relative paths to rebind paths already in the allocation dir
      "relative/to/task:/also/in/container"
    ]
  }
  ```

- `volume_driver` - (Optional) The name of the volume driver used to mount
  volumes. Must be used along with `volumes`. If `volume_driver` is omitted,
  then relative paths will be mounted from inside the allocation dir. If a
  `"local"` or other driver is used, then they may be named volumes instead.
  If `docker.volumes.enabled` is false then volume drivers and paths outside the
  allocation directory are disallowed.

  ```hcl
  config {
    volumes = [
      # Use named volume created outside nomad.
      "name-of-the-volume:/path/in/container"
    ]
    # Name of the Docker Volume Driver used by the container
    volume_driver = "pxd"
  }
  ```

- `work_dir` - (Optional) The working directory inside the container.

- `mount` - _Since 1.0.1_ (Optional) Specify a
  [mount](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/service_create/#add-bind-mounts-volumes-or-memory-filesystems)
  to be mounted into the container. Volume, bind, and tmpfs type mounts are supported. May be specified multiple times.

  ```hcl
  config {
    # sample volume mount
    mount {
      type = "volume"
      target = "/path/in/container"
      source = "name-of-volume"
      readonly = false
      volume_options {
        no_copy = false
        labels = {
          foo = "bar"
        }
        driver_config {
          name = "pxd"
          options {
            foo = "bar"
          }
        }
      }
    }

    # sample bind mount
    mount {
      type = "bind"
      target = "/path/in/container"
      source = "/path/in/host"
      readonly = false
      bind_options {
        propagation = "rshared"
      }
    }

    # sample tmpfs mount
    mount {
      type = "tmpfs"
      target = "/path/in/container"
      readonly = false
      tmpfs_options {
        size = 100000 # size in bytes
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- `mounts` - (_deprecated_: Replaced by `mount` in 1.0.1) (Optional) A list of
  [mounts](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/service_create/#add-bind-mounts-volumes-or-memory-filesystems)
  to be mounted into the container. Volume, bind, and tmpfs type mounts are supported.

  ```hcl
  config {
    mounts = [
      # sample volume mount
      {
        type = "volume"
        target = "/path/in/container"
        source = "name-of-volume"
        readonly = false
        volume_options = {
          no_copy = false
          labels = {
            foo = "bar"
          }
          driver_config = {
            name = "pxd"
            options = {
              foo = "bar"
            }
          }
        }
      },
      # sample bind mount
      {
        type = "bind"
        target = "/path/in/container"
        source = "/path/in/host"
        readonly = false
        bind_options = {
          propagation = "rshared"
        }
      },
      # sample tmpfs mount
      {
        type = "tmpfs"
        target = "/path/in/container"
        readonly = false
        tmpfs_options = {
          size = 100000 # size in bytes
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

- `devices` - (Optional) A list of
  [devices](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#add-host-device-to-container-device)
  to be exposed the container. `host_path` is the only required field. By default, the container will be able to
  `read`, `write` and `mknod` these devices. Use the optional `cgroup_permissions` field to restrict permissions.

  ```hcl
  config {
    devices = [
      {
        host_path = "/dev/sda1"
        container_path = "/dev/xvdc"
        cgroup_permissions = "r"
      },
      {
        host_path = "/dev/sda2"
        container_path = "/dev/xvdd"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

- `cap_add` - (Optional) A list of Linux capabilities as strings to pass
  directly to [`--cap-add`][]. Effective capabilities (computed from `cap_add`
  and `cap_drop`) must be a subset of the allowed capabilities configured with
  the [`allow_caps`][allow_caps] plugin option key in the client node's
  configuration. Note that `"all"` is not permitted here if the `allow_caps`
  field in the driver configuration doesn't also allow all capabilities. For
  example:

```hcl
config {
  cap_add = ["net_raw", "sys_time"]
}
```

- `cap_drop` - (Optional) A list of Linux capabilities as strings to pass
  directly to [`--cap-drop`][]. Effective capabilities (computed from `cap_add`
  and `cap_drop`) must be a subset of the allowed capabilities configured with
  the [`allow_caps`][allow_caps] plugin option key in the client node's
  configuration. For example:

```hcl
config {
  cap_drop = ["mknod"]
}
```

- `cpu_hard_limit` - (Optional) `true` or `false` (default). Use hard CPU
  limiting instead of soft limiting. By default this is `false` which means
  soft limiting is used and containers are able to burst above their CPU limit
  when there is idle capacity.

- `cpu_cfs_period` - (Optional) An integer value that specifies the duration in microseconds of the period
  during which the CPU usage quota is measured. The default is 100000 (0.1 second) and the maximum allowed
  value is 1000000 (1 second). See [here](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/resource_management_guide/sec-cpu#sect-cfs)
  for more details.

- `advertise_ipv6_address` - (Optional) `true` or `false` (default). Use the container's
  IPv6 address (GlobalIPv6Address in Docker) when registering services and checks.
  See [IPv6 Docker containers](/nomad/docs/job-specification/service#ipv6-docker-containers) for details.

- `readonly_rootfs` - (Optional) `true` or `false` (default). Mount
  the container's filesystem as read only.

- `runtime` - (Optional) A string representing a configured runtime to pass to docker.
  This is equivalent to the `--runtime` argument in the docker CLI
  For example, to use gVisor:

  ```hcl
  config {
    # gVisor runtime is runsc
    runtime = "runsc"
  }
  ```

- `pids_limit` - (Optional) An integer value that specifies the pid limit for
  the container. Defaults to unlimited.

Additionally, the docker driver supports customization of the container's user through the task's [`user` option](/nomad/docs/job-specification/task#user).

### Container Name

Nomad creates a container after pulling an image. Containers are named
`{taskName}-{allocId}`. This is necessary in order to place more than one
container from the same task on a host (e.g. with count > 1). This also means
that each container's name is unique across the cluster.

This is not configurable.

### Authentication

If you want to pull from a private repo (for example on dockerhub or quay.io),
you will need to specify credentials in your job via:

- the `auth` option in the task config.

- by storing explicit repository credentials or by specifying Docker
  `credHelpers` in a file and setting the auth [config](/nomad/docs/deploy/task-driver/docker#config)
  value on the client in the plugin options.

- by specifying an auth [helper](/nomad/docs/deploy/task-driver/docker#helper) on the client in the
  plugin options.

The `auth` object supports the following keys:

- `username` - (Optional) The account username.

- `password` - (Optional) The account password.

- `email` - (Optional) The account email.

- `server_address` - (Optional) The server domain/IP without the protocol.
  Docker Hub is used by default.

Example task-config:

```hcl
task "example" {
  driver = "docker"

  config {
    image = "secret/service"

    auth {
      username = "dockerhub_user"
      password = "dockerhub_password"
    }
  }
}
```

Example docker-config, using two helper scripts in `$PATH`,
"docker-credential-ecr-login" and "docker-credential-vault":

```json
{
  "auths": {
    "internal.repo": {
      "auth": "`echo -n '<username>:<password>' | base64 -w0`"
    }
  },
  "credHelpers": {
    "<XYZ>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com": "ecr-login"
  },
  "credsStore": "secretservice"
}
```

Example agent configuration, using a helper script
"docker-credential-ecr-login" in `$PATH`

```hcl
client {
  enabled = true
}

plugin "docker" {
  config {
    auth {
      # Nomad will prepend "docker-credential-" to the helper value and call
      # that script name.
      helper = "ecr-login"
    }
  }
}
```

!> **Be Careful!** At this time these credentials are stored in Nomad in plain
text. Secrets management will be added in a later release.

## Insecure Registries

In order to pull images from a registry without TLS, you must configure the
Docker daemon's `insecure-registries` flag. No additional Nomad client
configuration is required. You should only allow insecure registries for
registries running locally on the client or when the communication to the
registry is otherwise encrypted. List the `insecure-registries` flag in the
`dockerd` [configuration file](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/).

```json
{
  "insecure-registries": ["example.local:5000"]
}
```

## Networking

Docker supports a variety of networking configurations, including using host
interfaces, SDNs, etc. Nomad uses `bridged` networking by default, like Docker.

You can specify other networking options, including custom networking plugins
in Docker 1.9. **You may need to perform additional configuration on the host
in order to make these work.** This additional configuration is outside the
scope of Nomad.

### Allocating Ports

You can allocate ports to your task using the port syntax described on the
[networking page](/nomad/docs/job-specification/network). Here is a recap:

```hcl
group {
  network {
    port "http" {}
    port "https" {}
  }
  task "example" {
    driver = "docker"
    config {
      ports = ["http", "https"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Forwarding and Exposing Ports

A Docker container typically specifies which port a service will listen on by
specifying the `EXPOSE` directive in the `Dockerfile`.

Because dynamic ports will not match the ports exposed in your Dockerfile,
Nomad will automatically expose any ports specified in the `ports` field.

These ports will be identified via environment variables. For example:

```hcl
group {
  network {
    port "http" {}
  }
  task "api" {
    driver = "docker"
    config {
      ports = ["http"]
    }
  }
}
```

If Nomad allocates port `23332` to your api task for `http`, `23332` will be
automatically exposed and forwarded to your container, and the driver will set
an environment variable `NOMAD_PORT_http` with the value `23332` that you can
read inside your container.

This provides an easy way to use the `host` networking option for better
performance.

### Using the Port Map

If you prefer to use the traditional port-mapping method, you can specify the
the `to` field in the port configuration. It looks like this:

```hcl
group "example" {
  network {
    port "redis" { to = 6379 }
  }
  task "example" {
    driver = "docker"

    config {
      image = "redis"
      ports = ["redis"]
    }
  }
}
```

If Nomad allocates port `23332` to your allocation, the Docker driver will
automatically setup the port mapping from `23332` on the host to `6379` in your
container, so it will just work.

Note that by default this only works with `bridged` networking mode. It may
also work with custom networking plugins which implement the same API for
expose and port forwarding.

#### Deprecated `port_map` Syntax

Up until Nomad 0.12, ports could be specified in a task's resource block and set using the docker
`port_map` field. As more features have been added to the group network resource allocation, task based
network resources are deprecated. With it the `port_map` field is also deprecated and can only be used
with task network resources.

Users should migrate their jobs to define ports in the group network block and specified which ports
a task maps with the `ports` field.

### Advertising Container IPs

When using network plugins like `weave` that assign containers a routable IP
address, that address will automatically be used in any `service`
advertisements for the task. You may override what address is advertised by
using the `address_mode` parameter on a `service`. See
[service](/nomad/docs/job-specification/service) for details.

### Networking Protocols

The Docker driver configures ports on both the `tcp` and `udp` protocols.

This is not configurable.

### Other Networking Modes

Some networking modes like `container` or `none` will require coordination
outside of Nomad. First-class support for these options may be improved later
through Nomad plugins or dynamic job configuration.
