## Nomad Enterprise Licensing

Licensing capabilities were added to Nomad Enterprise v0.12.0. The license is
set once for a region and automatically propagates to all servers within the
region. Nomad Enterprise can be downloaded from the [releases site].

Click [here](https://www.hashicorp.com/go/nomad-enterprise) to set up a demo or
request a trial of Nomad Enterprise.

~> **Note:** A Nomad Enterprise cluster cannot be downgraded to the open
source version of Nomad. Servers running the open source version of Nomad will
panic if they are joined to a Nomad Enterprise cluster. See issue [gh-9958]
for more details.

## Evaluating Nomad Enterprise

Nomad Enterprise can be used without a valid license for 6 hours. When a Nomad
Enterprise server starts without a license configuration option (see [license
configuration]) it uses a temporary trial license. This license is valid
for 6 hours.

You can inspect the temporary license using `nomad license get`.

```
$ nomad license get
Product        = nomad
License Status = valid
License ID     = temporary-license
Customer ID    = temporary license customer
Issued At      = 2021-03-29 14:47:29.024191 -0400 EDT
Expires At     = 2021-03-29 20:47:29.024191 -0400 EDT
Terminates At  = 2021-03-29 20:47:29.024191 -0400 EDT
Datacenter     = *
Modules:
        governance-policy
        multicluster-and-efficiency
Licensed Features:
        Automated Upgrades
        Enhanced Read Scalability
        Redundancy Zones
        Namespaces
        Resource Quotas
        Audit Logging
        Sentinel Policies
        Multiregion Deployments
        Automated Backups
        Multi-Vault Namespaces
        Dynamic Application Sizing
```

After the trial period, if you attempt to start Nomad with the same state or
`data_dir`, Nomad will wait a brief grace period time to allow an operator to
set a valid license before shutting down.

## Expiring Licenses

### Temporary Licenses

As a Nomad Enterprise license approaches its expiration time, Nomad will
periodically log a warning message about the approaching expiration. Below
shows log excerpts of the warnings.

```

```

Since this was a temporary license, when
the temporary license expires, the agent shuts down.

### Valid, Non-Temporary Licenses

License expiry is handled differently for valid enterprise licenses. Nomad
licensing will continue to log about the expiring license above, but when the
license fully expires (the Termination Time is reached) the server _will not_
shut down. Instead, of shutting down, enterprise functionality will become limited. Only
read operations on enterprise endpoints will be supported, and write operations
will return an error.

~> **Note:** When an enterprise server starts and the license is expired, Nomad
will wait for a short grace period to apply a valid license before shutting
down.

## Setting the License

See the server [license configuration] reference documentation on all the
options to set an enterprise license.

When setting a Nomad Enterprise license there are two options to pick from. You
can set the license via the CLI or API after the server is running, or Nomad
can automatically load the file from disk or environment when it starts.

To set the license via CLI, see the [license command] documentation. To set the
license programmatically see the [license endpoint] API documentation.

To configure Nomad to load the license from disk or environment see the server
[license configuration].

## Operating Nomad Enterprise with a License

In order to immediately alert operators of a bad configuration setting, if a
license configuration option is a completely invalid license, the nomad server
will exit with an error.

```
NOMAD_LICENSE=misconfigured nomad agent -dev
==> No configuration files loaded
==> Starting Nomad agent...
==> Error starting agent: server setup failed: failed to initialize enterprise licensing: a file license was configured but the license is invalid: error decoding version: expected integer
```

Some Nomad servers are controlled with a level of automation or could be part
of an autoscaling group. If an operator accidentally has an old, expired
license set as the disk or environment license, the server will emit a warning
log, but not exit if a valid license exists in raft. If a valid license
doesn't exist in raft then the server will enter a grace period before exiting.

```
2021-03-29T16:33:01.691-0400 [WARN]  nomad.licensing: Configured enterprise
license file is expired! Falling back to temporary license. Please update, or
remove license configuration if setting the license via CLI/API
```

## Overriding a File or Environment License

A Nomad Enterprise server that starts with an automatically loaded file or
environment variable license is able to be overridden using the CLI or API.
When setting a different license from the server's file license a warning will
be emitted.

If an older (determined by license issue date), but valid license is applied,
an error is returned.

```
$ nomad license put nomadlicense.hclic
Error putting license: Unexpected response code: 500 (error setting license: requested license is older than current one, use force to override)
```

This can be overridden by setting the `-force` flag.

```
$ nomad license put -force nomadlicense.hclic

WARNING: The server's configured file license is now outdated. Please update or
remove the server's license configuration to prevent initialization issues with
potentially expired licenses.

Successfully applied license
```

See the [License commands](/docs/commands/license) for more information on
interacting with the Enterprise License.
