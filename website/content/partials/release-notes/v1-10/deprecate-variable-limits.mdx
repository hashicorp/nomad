#### Quota specification variable_limits deprecated <EnterpriseAlert product="nomad" inline/>

The quota specification's `variable_limits` field is deprecated. We replaced it
with a new [`storage` block](/nomad/docs/other-specifications/quota#storage)
with a `variables` field, under the `region_limit` block. Existing quotas will
be automatically migrated during server upgrade. We will remove the
`variables_limit` field from the quota specification in Nomad 1.12.0.
