# Command: var purge

The `var purge` command permanently removes the variable at the provided path
from Nomad's secure variable storage. If no key exists at the path, no action
is taken and the command will exit with a configurable exit code.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad var purge [options] <path>
```

The `var purge` command requires the path to the specification file. The
specification can be read from standard input by setting the path to `-`.

If ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the
`secure-variable:purge` capability for the namespace and path of the secure
variable to be purged.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Output Options

- `-of` `(string: varies)`: Specify the format to print the secure variable that
  was purged. Valid formats are `none`, `table`, `json`, `hcl`, or `go-template`.
  Defaults to `none` when the output is a terminal; defaults to `json` when the
  output is redirected.

- `-q`: Quiet output; silences all non-error output. This flag overrides any
  value set using the `-of` option.


## Command Options

- `-check-index` `(int: varies)`: If set, the secure variable is only updated if
  the provided index matches the server-side version's modify index. This value
  defaults to the value provided in the variable specification or should be
  manually provided when a specification is not provided.

- `-exit-code-not-found` `(int: 1)`: Exit code to set if the secure variable is
   not found. Defaults to 1.

- `-y`: Answer yes to all confirmation prompts.


## Examples

Purge the secure variable at the "secret/creds" path.

```shell-session
$ nomad var purge -y secret/creds
Successfully purged secure variable "secret/creds"!
```
