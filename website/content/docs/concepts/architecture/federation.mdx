# Federation

Nomad federation is a multi-cluster orchestration and management feature that allows multiple Nomad
clusters, defined as a region, to work together seamlessly. By federating clusters, you benefit
from improved scalability, fault tolerance, and centralized management of workloads across various
data centers or geographical locations.

## Cross-Region request forwarding

API calls can include a `region` query parameter that defines the Nomad region the query is
specified for. If this is not the local region, Nomad transparently forwards the request to a
server in the requested region. When you omit the query parameter, Nomad uses the region of the
server that is processing the request.

## Replication

Nomad writes the following objects in the authoritative region and replicates them to all federated
regions:

- ACL [policies][acl_policy], [roles][acl_role], [auth methods][acl_auth_method],
  [binding rules][acl_binding_rule], and [global tokens][acl_token]
- [Namespaces][namespace]
- [Node pools][node_pool]
- [Quota specifications][quota]
- [Sentinel policies][sentinel_policies]

When creating, updating, or deleting these objects, Nomad always sends the request to the
authoritative region using RPC forwarding.

Nomad starts replication routines on each federated cluster's leader server in a hub and spoke
design. The routines then use blocking queries to receive updates from the authoritative region to
mirror in their own state store. These routines also implement rate limiting, so that busy clusters
do not degrade due to overly aggressive replication processes.

<Note>
Nomad writes ACL local tokens in the region where you make the request and  does not replicate
those local tokens.

## Multi-Region job deployments <EnterpriseAlert inline />

Nomad job deployments can use the [`multiregion`][] block when running in federated mode.
Multiregion configuration instructs Nomad to register and run the job on all the specified regions,
removing the need for multiple job specification copies and registration on each region.
Multiregion jobs do not provide regional failover in the event of failure.
