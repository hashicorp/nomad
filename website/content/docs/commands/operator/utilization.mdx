# `nomad operator utilization` command reference

The `operator utilization` command allows Nomad Enterprise users to generate
utilization reporting bundles. If you have disabled automated reporting, use
this command to manually generate the report and send it to HashiCorp. Nomad
takes a new snapshot when there are no snapshots from the past twenty-four
hours.

If ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the `operator:write`
capability.

<Note title="Nomad Enterprise">

Refer to the [manual license utilization
reporting](/nomad/docs/enterprise/license/manual-reporting) page to learn more
about reporting your Nomad Enterprise license utilization.

</Note>

## Command Options

- `-message` `(string; "")` - Provide context about the conditions under which
  the report was generated and submitted. This message is not included in the
  utilization bundle but is included in the Nomad server logs.

- `-output` `(string; "")` - Specifies the output path for the bundle. Defaults
  to a time-based generated file name in the current working directory.

- `-today-only` `(bool: false)` - Include snapshots from the previous 24 hours,
  not historical snapshots.

## General options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Examples

Create a utilization reporting bundle that includes all persisted historical
snapshots and has the default bundle name
(`nomad-utilization-<time_stamp>.json`).

```shell-session
$ nomad operator utilization
Success! Utilization reporting bundle written to: nomad-utilization-2024-02-16T22-23-25Z.json
```

Create a utilization reporting bundle with a message about the bundle, and
output the file at the specified path, `/utilization/reports/latest.json`.

```shell-session
$ nomad operator utilization \
    -message="Change Control 654987" \
    -output="/utilization/reports/latest.json"
```

**Example output**

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
Success! Utilization reporting bundle written to: /utilization/reports/latest.json
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The message, `Change Control 654987`, is included in the _server log_, but not
in the bundle.

**Example entry in the server log**

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
[INFO]  reporting: reporting bundle generated: message="Change Control 654987"
```

</CodeBlockConfig>
