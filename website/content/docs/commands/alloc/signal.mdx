# Command: alloc signal

The `alloc signal` command allows a user to perform an in place signal of an
an entire allocation or individual task.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad alloc signal [options] <allocation> <task>
```

This command accepts a single allocation ID and a task name. The task name must
be part of the allocation and the task must be currently running. The task name
is optional and if omitted every task in the allocation will be signaled.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the
`alloc-lifecycle`, `read-job`, and `list-jobs` capabilities for the
allocation's namespace.

$ nomad alloc signal eb17e557

Could not find task named: foo, found:
* test
<blocking>
```
