# Command: status

The `status` command displays the status output for any Nomad resource.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad status [options] <identifier>
```

The status command accepts any Nomad identifier or identifier prefix as its sole
argument. The command detects the type of the identifier and routes to the
appropriate status command to display more detailed output.

If the ID is omitted, the command lists out all of the existing jobs. This is
for backwards compatibility and should not be relied on.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Examples
