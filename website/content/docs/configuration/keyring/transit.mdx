# `transit` keyring

The Vault transit keyring configures Nomad to use Vault's Transit Secret Engine
to wrap its keyring. This example shows configuring Vault Transit through the
Nomad configuration file by providing all the required values.

```hcl
keyring "transit" {

  active = true
  name   = "example"

  # fields specific to transit
  address            = "https://vault:8200"
  token              = "s.Qf1s5zigZ4OX6akYjQXJC1jY"
  disable_renewal    = "false"

  # Key configuration
  key_name           = "transit_key_name"
  mount_path         = "transit/"
  namespace          = "ns1/"

  # TLS Configuration
  tls_ca_cert        = "/etc/vault/ca_cert.pem"
  tls_client_cert    = "/etc/vault/client_cert.pem"
  tls_client_key     = "/etc/vault/ca_cert.pem"
  tls_server_name    = "vault"
  tls_skip_verify    = "false"
}
```

## `transit` parameters

These parameters apply to the `keyring` stanza in the Nomad configuration file:

- `key_name` `(string: <required>)`: The transit key to use for encryption and
  decryption.

- `key_id_prefix` `(string: "")`: An optional string to add to the key id of
  values wrapped by this transit keyring. This can help disambiguate between two
  transit keyring.

- `mount_path` `(string: <required>)`: The mount path to the transit secret
  engine.

- `disable_renewal` `(string: "false")`: Disables the automatic renewal of the
  token in case the lifecycle of the token is managed with some other mechanism
  outside of Vault, such as Vault Agent.

Set the following parameters in the `keyring` block. If not set here, Nomad uses
the values set in the server's [`vault`][vault_config] block. You must set
required fields either here or the `vault` block.

- `address` `(string: <required>)`: The full address to the Vault cluster.
  Alternately specify via the `VAULT_ADDR` environment variable.

- `token` `(string: <required>)`: The Vault token to use. Alternately specify
  via the `VAULT_TOKEN` environment variable.

- `namespace` `(string: "")`: The namespace path to the transit secret engine.
   Alternately specify via the `VAULT_NAMESPACE` environment variable.

- `tls_ca_cert` `(string: "")`: Specifies the path to the CA certificate file
  used for communication with the Vault server. Alternately specify via the
  `VAULT_CACERT` environment variable.

- `tls_client_cert` `(string: "")`: Specifies the path to the client certificate
  for communication with the Vault server. Alternately specify via the
  `VAULT_CLIENT_CERT` environment variable.

- `tls_client_key` `(string: "")`: Specifies the path to the private key for
  communication with the Vault server. Alternately specify via the
  `VAULT_CLIENT_KEY` environment variable.

- `tls_server_name` `(string: "")`: Name to use as the SNI host when connecting
  to the Vault server via TLS. Alternately specify via the
  `VAULT_TLS_SERVER_NAME` environment variable.

- `tls_skip_verify` `(bool: "false")`: Disable verification of TLS certificates.
  Using this option is highly discouraged and decreases the security of data
  transmissions to and from the Vault server. Alternately specify via the
  `VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY` environment variable.

## Authentication

You must provide authentication-related values either as environment variables
or as configuration parameters.

~> **Note:** Although the configuration file lets you to pass in `VAULT_TOKEN`
as part of the keyring's parameters, we strongly recommended that you set these
values via environment variables.

The Vault authentication token needs the following permissions on the transit
key:

```hcl
path "<mount path>/encrypt/<key name>" {
  capabilities = ["update"]
}

path "<mount path>/decrypt/<key name>" {
  capabilities = ["update"]
}
```

Other considerations for the token used:
* It should probably be an [orphan token][], otherwise when the parent token
  expires or gets revoked the keyring breaks.
* Consider making it a [periodic token][] and not setting an explicit max TTL,
  otherwise at some point it ceases to be renewable.

## Key rotation

This keyring supports key rotation using the Transit Secret Engine's key
rotation endpoints. Refer to [Vault docs][rotate_doc]. Old keys must not be
disabled or deleted and are used to decrypt older data.
