# Nomad Enterprise

[Nomad Enterprise](https://www.hashicorp.com/go/nomad-enterprise) adds collaboration, 
operational, and governance capabilities to Nomad. Namespaces allow multiple 
teams to safely use a shared multi-region deployment. With Resource Quotas, 
operators can limit resource consumption across teams or projects. Sentinel 
policies enable enforcement of arbitrary fine-grained policies on job submission. 
Advanced Autopilot capabilities enable automated server upgrades, enhanced scalability 
for reads and scheduling, and hot server failover on a per availability zone basis. See the 
links below for a detailed overview of each feature.

- [Sentinel Policies](/docs/enterprise/sentinel/index.html)
- [Advanced Autopilot](/docs/enterprise/autopilot/index.html)
