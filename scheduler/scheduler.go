// into Nomad itself. They are invoked to process a single evaluation at
// a time. The evaluation may result in task allocations which are computed
// optimistically, as there are many concurrent evaluations being processed.
// The task allocations are submitted as a plan, and the current leader will
// coordinate the commmits to prevent oversubscription or improper allocations
// based on stale state.
