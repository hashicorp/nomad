# nomad job start command reference

Use the `nomad job start` command to start the latest version of an existing job
with a status of Stopped. Refer to [Job statuses] for status explanations.

## Usage

```shell-session
nomad job start [options] <job_id>
```

The `nomad job start` command requires the job ID. Nomad creates new version of
the job based on its most recent version. This command fails if the job is not
registered or not currently stopped.

When Nomad uses ACLs, the `nomad job start` command requires a token with one of
the following capabilities based on the specific scenario:

- The `submit-job`capability for the job's namespace

## Options

- `-detach`: Return immediately instead of monitoring. Nomad outputs a new
  evaluation ID, which you can use to examine the evaluation using the
  [eval status] command.

- `-verbose`: Show full information.

## Examples

Start a previously stopped job.

```shell-session
$ nomad job status
ID       Type     Priority  Status          Submit Date
example  service  50        dead (stopped)  2025-02-11T15:33:27-05:00
