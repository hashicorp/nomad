  Build an archive of debug data.

# Command: debug

The `debug` command builds an archive containing Nomad cluster
configuration and state information, Nomad server and client node
logs, and pprof profiles from the selected servers and client nodes.

If no selection option is specified, the debug archive contains only
cluster meta information.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad operator debug [options]
```

This command accepts comma separated `server-id` and `node-id` IDs for
monitoring and pprof profiling. If IDs are provided, the command will
monitor logs for the `duration`, saving a snapshot of Nomad state
every `interval`. Captured logs and configurations are subjected to
redaction, but may still contain sensitive information and the archive
contents should be reviewed before sharing.

If an `output` path is provided, `debug` will create a timestamped
directory in that path instead of an archive. By default, the command
creates a compressed tar archive in the current directory.

Consul and Vault status and version information are included if
configured.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Debug Options

- `-duration=2m`: Set the duration of the log monitor command.
  Defaults to `"2m"`. Logs will be captured from specified servers and
  nodes at `log-level`.

- `-interval=2m`: The interval between snapshots of the Nomad state.
   If unspecified, only one snapshot is captured.

- `-log-level=DEBUG`: The log level to monitor. Defaults to `DEBUG`.

- `-node-id=n1,n2`: Comma separated list of Nomad client node ids, to
   monitor for logs and include pprof data. Accepts id prefixes.

- `-server-id=s1,s2`: Comma separated list of Nomad server names, or
   the special server name "leader" to monitor for logs and include
   pprof data.

- `-output=path`: Path to the parent directory of the output
   directory. Defaults to the current directory. If specified, no
   archive is built.

- `-consul-token`: Token used to query Consul. Defaults to `CONSUL_TOKEN`

- `-vault-token`: Token used to query Vault. Defaults to `VAULT_TOKEN`

## Output

This command prints the name of the timestamped archive file produced.

## Examples

```shell-session
$ nomad operator debug -duration 20s -interval 5s -server-id leader -node-id 6e,dd
