# Command: stop

The `stop` command is used to stop a running job and signals the scheduler
to cancel all of the running allocations.

## Usage

```
nomad stop [options] <job>
```

The stop command requires a single argument, specifying the job ID or prefix to
cancel. If there is an exact match based on the provided job ID or prefix, then
the job will be cancelled. Otherwise, a list of matching jobs and information
will be displayed.

Stop will issue a request to deregister the matched job and then invoke an
interactive monitor that exits automatically once the scheduler has processed
the request. It is safe to exit the monitor early using ctrl+c.

## General Options

<%= partial "docs/commands/_general_options" %>

## Stop Options

* `-detach`: Return immediately instead of entering monitor mode. After the
  deregister command is submitted, a new evaluation ID is printed to the screen,
  which can be used to examine the evaluation using the
  [eval-status](/docs/commands/eval-status.html) command.

* `-verbose`: Show full information.

* `-yes`: Automatic yes to prompts.

* `-purge`: Purge is used to stop the job and purge it from the system. If not
set, the job will still be queryable and will be purged by the garbage
collector.


## Examples

Stop the job with ID "job1":

```
$ nomad stop job1
==> Monitoring evaluation "43bfe672"
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "43bfe672" finished with status "complete"
```

Stop the job with ID "job1" and return immediately:

```
$ nomad stop -detach job1
