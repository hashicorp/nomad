# containerd Task Driver

Name: `containerd-driver`

Homepage: https://github.com/Roblox/nomad-driver-containerd

containerd ([`containerd.io`](https://containerd.io)) is a lightweight container
daemon for running and managing container lifecycle. Docker daemon also uses
containerd.

```hcl
dockerd (docker daemon) --> containerd --> containerd-shim --> runc
```

`nomad-driver-containerd` enables Nomad clients to launch containers directly
using containerd, without Docker. The Docker daemon is therefore not required on
the host system.

See the [project's homepage](https://github.com/Roblox/nomad-driver-containerd)
for more details.

## Client Requirements

The containerd task driver is not built into Nomad. It must be
[`downloaded`][releases] onto the client host in the configured plugin
directory.

- Linux (Ubuntu >=16.04) with [`containerd`](https://containerd.io/downloads/) (>=1.3) installed.

- [`containerd-driver`][releases] binary in Nomad's [plugin_dir][].

## Capabilities

The `containerd-driver` implements the following [capabilities](/docs/internals/plugins/task-drivers#capabilities-capabilities-error).

| Feature              | Implementation          |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| send signals         | true                    |
| exec                 | true                    |
| filesystem isolation | none                    |
| network isolation    | host, group, task, none |
| volume mounting      | true                    |

For sending signals, one can use `nomad alloc signal` command.<br/>
For exec'ing into the container, one can use `nomad alloc exec` command.

## Task Configuration

Since Docker also relies on containerd for managing container lifecycle, the
example job created by [`nomad init -short`][nomad-init] can easily be adapted
to use `containerd-driver` instead:

```hcl
job "redis" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]

  group "redis-group" {
    task "redis-task" {
      driver = "containerd-driver"

      config {
        image = "docker.io/library/redis:alpine"
      }

      resources {
        cpu    = 500
        memory = 256
        network {
          mbits = 10
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The containerd task driver supports the following parameters:

- `image` - (Required) OCI image (Docker is also OCI compatible) for your
  container.

```hcl
config {
  image = "docker.io/library/redis:alpine"
}
```

- `command` - (Optional) Command to override command defined in the image.

```hcl
config {
  command = "some-command"
}
```

- `args` - (Optional) Arguments to the command.

```hcl
config {
  args = [
    "arg1",
    "arg2",
  ]
}
```

- `cwd` - (Optional) Specify the current working directory (cwd) for your container process.
  If the directory does not exist, one will be created for you.

- `privileged` - (Optional) `true` or `false` (default) Run container in
  privileged mode. Your container will have all Linux capabilities when running
  in privileged mode.

```hcl
config {
  privileged = true
}
```

- `host_dns` - (Optional) `true` (default) or `false` By default, a container
  launched using `containerd-driver` will use host `/etc/resolv.conf`. This is
  similar to [Docker's behavior]. However, if you don't want to use
  host DNS, you can turn off this flag by setting `host_dns=false`.

- `seccomp` - (Optional) Enable default seccomp profile. List of [allowed syscalls].

- `seccomp_profile` - (Optional) Path to custom seccomp profile.
  `seccomp` must be set to `true` in order to use `seccomp_profile`.

  The default `docker` seccomp profile found in the [Moby repository]
  can be downloaded, and modified (by removing/adding syscalls) to create a custom seccomp profile.
  The custom seccomp profile can then be saved under `/opt/seccomp/seccomp.json` on the Nomad client nodes.

```hcl
config {
  seccomp         = true
  seccomp_profile = "/opt/seccomp/seccomp.json"
}
```

- `readonly_rootfs` - (Optional) `true` or `false` (default) Container root
  filesystem will be read-only.

```hcl
config {
  readonly_rootfs = true
}
```

- `host_network` ((#host_network)) - (Optional) `true` or `false` (default)
  Enable host network. This is equivalent to `--net=host` in docker.

```hcl
config {
  host_network = true
}
```

- `cap_add` - (Optional) Add individual capabilities.

```hcl
config {
  cap_add = [
    "CAP_SYS_ADMIN",
    "CAP_CHOWN",
    "CAP_SYS_CHROOT"
  ]
}
```

- `cap_drop` - (Optional) Drop individual capabilities.

```hcl
config {
  cap_drop = [
    "CAP_SYS_ADMIN",
    "CAP_CHOWN",
    "CAP_SYS_CHROOT"
  ]
}
```

- `devices` - (Optional) A list of devices to be exposed to the container.

```hcl
config {
  devices = [
    "/dev/loop0",
    "/dev/loop1"
  ]
}
```

- `mounts` - (Optional) A list of mounts to be mounted in the container. Volume,
  bind and tmpfs type mounts are supported. fstab style [`mount options`][] are
  supported.

  - `type` - (Optional) Supported values are `volume`, `bind` or `tmpfs`.
    **Default:** `volume`.

  - `target` - (Required) Target path in the container.

  - `source` - (Optional) Source path on the host.

  - `options` - (Optional) fstab style [`mount options`][]. **NOTE:** For bind
    mounts, at least `rbind` and `ro` are required.

```hcl
config {
  mounts = [
    {
      type = "bind"
      target = "/tmp/t1"
      source = "/tmp/s1"
      options = ["rbind", "ro"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Networking

`nomad-driver-containerd` supports **host** and **bridge** networks.

**NOTE:** `host` and `bridge` are mutually exclusive options, and only one of
them should be used at a time.

1. **Host** network can be enabled by setting `host_network` to `true` in task
   config of the job spec (see [host_network][host-network] under Task
   Configuration).

2. **Bridge** network can be enabled by setting the `network` stanza in the task
   group section of the job spec.

```hcl
network {
  mode = "bridge"
}
```

You need to install CNI plugins on Nomad client nodes under `/opt/cni/bin`
before you can use `bridge` networks.

**Instructions for installing CNI plugins.**

```hcl
 $ curl -L -o cni-plugins.tgz https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/v0.8.6/cni-plugins-linux-amd64-v0.8.6.tgz
 $ sudo mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin
 $ sudo tar -C /opt/cni/bin -xzf cni-plugins.tgz
```

Also, ensure your Linux operating system distribution has been configured
to allow container traffic through the bridge network to be routed via iptables.
These tunables can be set as follows:

```hcl
 $ echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-arptables
 $ echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-ip6tables
 $ echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-iptables
```

To preserve these settings on startup of a Nomad client node, add a file
including the following to `/etc/sysctl.d/` or remove the file your Linux
distribution puts in that directory.

```hcl
 net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables = 1
 net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
 net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
```

## Port Forwarding

Nomad supports both `static` and `dynamic` port mapping.

1. **Static ports**

Static port mapping can be added in the `network` stanza.

```hcl
network {
  mode = "bridge"
  port "lb" {
    static = 8889
    to     = 8889
  }
}
```
Here, `host` port `8889` is mapped to `container` port `8889`.<br/>
**NOTE:** static ports are usually not recommended, except for
`system` or specialized jobs like load balancers.

2. **Dynamic ports**

Dynamic port mapping is also enabled in the `network` stanza.

```hcl
network {
  mode = "bridge"
  port "http" {
    to = 8080
  }
}
```
Here, nomad will allocate a dynamic port on the `host` and that port
will be mapped to `8080` in the container.

You can read more about configuring networking under the [`network`] stanza documentation.

## Service discovery

Nomad schedules workloads of various types across a cluster of generic hosts.
Because of this, placement is not known in advance and you will need to use
service discovery to connect tasks to other services deployed across your cluster.
Nomad integrates with Consul to provide service discovery and monitoring.

A [`service`] block can be added to your job spec, to enable service discovery.

The service stanza instructs Nomad to register a service with Consul.

## Plugin Options ((#plugin_options))

- `enabled` - (Optional) The `containerd` driver may be disabled on hosts by
  setting this option to `false` (defaults to `true`).

- `containerd_runtime` - (Required) Runtime for `containerd` e.g.
  `io.containerd.runc.v1` or `io.containerd.runc.v2`

- `stats_interval` - (Optional) This value defines how frequently you want to
  send `TaskStats` to nomad client. (defaults to `1 second`).

An example of using these plugin options with the new [plugin syntax][plugin] is
shown below:

```hcl
plugin "containerd-driver" {
  config {
    enabled = true
    containerd_runtime = "io.containerd.runc.v2"
    stats_interval = "5s"
  }
}
```

Please note the plugin name should match whatever name you have specified for
the external driver in the [plugin_dir][plugin_dir] directory.
