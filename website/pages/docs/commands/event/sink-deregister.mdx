# Command: event sink deregister

The `event sink deregister` command is used to deregister an event sink.
Deregistering an event sink will remove the event sink from Nomad, stopping it
from sending events to the sink.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad event sink deregister <id>
```

The `event sink deregister` command requires a single argument, the event sink
ID.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a management token.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Example

Deregister an event sink:

```shell-session
$ nomad event sink deregister job-webhook
Successfully deregistered "job-webhook" event sink!
```
