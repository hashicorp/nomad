# Command: operator

The `operator` command provides cluster-level tools for Nomad operators, such
as interacting with the Raft subsystem. This was added in Nomad 0.5.5.

~> Use this command with extreme caution, as improper use could lead to a Nomad
outage and even loss of data.

See the [Outage Recovery guide] guide for some examples of how this command is
used. For an API to perform these operations programmatically, please see the
documentation for the [Operator] endpoint.
