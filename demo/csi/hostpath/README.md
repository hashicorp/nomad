# Hostpath CSI Plugin

This directory includes a demo using the [CSI host path
driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-driver-host-path) to create
local "host path" volumes that can be mounted via the Nomad CSI
implementation.

## What Is This For?

The hostpath plugin is for demonstration and development purposes only. It
shouldn't be used for production. If you want to get a quick idea of how CSI
works on Nomad in a Vagrant environment, this demo is a good option.

## Requirements

* A running Nomad cluster with `docker.privileged.enabled = true`. The Nomad
  developer [Vagrantfile](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/blob/main/Vagrantfile)
  in this repo is suitable.

Running the `run.sh` script in this directory will output the Nomad command
used to run the demo, as well as their outputs:

```
$ nomad job run ./plugin.nomad
