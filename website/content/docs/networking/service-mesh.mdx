# Service mesh

Service mesh is a networking pattern that deploys and configures
infrastructure to directly connect workloads. One of the most common pieces of
infrastructure deployed are sidecar proxies. These proxies usually run
alongside the main workload in an isolated network namespace such that all
network traffic flows through the proxy.

The proxies are often referred to as the **data plane** since they are
responsible for _moving data_ while the components that configure them are part
of the **control plane** because they are responsible for controlling the _flow
of data_.

By funneling traffic through a common layer of infrastructure the control plane
is able to centralize and automatically apply configuration to all proxies to
enable features such as automated traffic encryption, fine-grained routing, and
service-based access control permissions throughout the entire mesh.

## Consul Service Mesh

Nomad has native integration with Consul to provide service mesh capabilities.
The [`connect`][] block is the entrypoint for all service mesh configuration.
Nomad automatically deploys a sidecar proxy task to all allocations that have a
[`sidecar_service`][] block.

This proxy task is responsible for exposing the service to the mesh and can
also be used to access other services from within the allocation. These
external services are called upstreams and are declared using the
[`upstreams`][] block.

The allocation `network_mode` must be set to `bridge` for network isolation and
all external traffic is provided by the sidecar.

~> **Warning:** To fully isolate your workloads make sure to bind them only to
   the `loopback` interface.

The job below exposes a service called `api` to the mesh:

```hcl
job "..."  {
  # ...
  group "..." {
    network {
      mode = "bridge"

      port "http" {}
    }

    service {
      name = "api"
      port = "http"

      connect {
        sidecar_service {}
      }
    }
    # ...
  }
}
```

To access this service, a job can be configured as follows:

```hcl
job "..." {
  # ...
  group "..." {
    network {
      mode = "bridge"
      # ...
    }

    service {
      # ...
      connect {
        sidecar_service {
          proxy {
            upstreams {
              destination_name = "api"
              local_bind_port  = 8080
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

A request starting from a task within an allocation of this job follows the
path:

1. The task makes a request to `localhost:8080` which is the port where the
   proxy binds the `api` service as an upstream.

2. The proxy, configured by Consul, forwards the request to a proxy running
   within an allocation that is part of the `api` service.

3. The proxy for the `api` service forwards the request to the local port in
   the allocation.

4. The response is sent back to the first task following the same path in
   reverse.

The IP and port to use to connect to an upstream can also be read from the
[`NOMAD_UPSTREAM_ADDR_<upstream>`][runtime_network] environment variable.

### Envoy proxy

Consul Service Mesh uses [Envoy][] as proxy. Nomad calls Consul's [`consul
connect envoy -bootstrap`][consul_cli_envoy] CLI command to generate the
initial proxy configuration.

Nomad injects a prestart sidecar Docker task to run the Envoy proxy. This task
can be customized using the [`sidecar_task`][] block.

### Gateways

Since the mesh defines a closed boundary that only selected services can
participate in, there are specialized proxies called gateways that can be used
for mesh-wide connectivity. Nomad can deploy these gateways using the
[`gateway`][] block. Nomad injects an Envoy proxy task to any `group` with a
`gateway` service.

The types of gateways provided by Consul Service Mesh are:

- **Mesh gateways** allow communication between different service meshes and
  are deployed using the [`mesh`][] parameter.

- **Ingress gateways** allow services outside the mesh to connect to services
  inside the mesh and are deployed using the [`ingress`][] parameter.

- **Egress gateways** allow services inside the mesh to communication with
  services outside the mesh and are deployed using the [`terminating`][]
  parameter.
