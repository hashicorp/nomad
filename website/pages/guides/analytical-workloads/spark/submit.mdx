# Submitting Applications

The [`spark-submit`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html)
script located in Spark’s `bin` directory is used to launch applications on a
cluster. Spark applications can be submitted to Nomad in either `client` mode
or `cluster` mode.

## Client Mode

In `client` mode, the application driver runs on a machine that is not
necessarily in the Nomad cluster. The driver’s `SparkContext` creates a Nomad
job to run Spark executors. The executors connect to the driver and run Spark
tasks on behalf of the application. When the driver’s SparkContext is stopped,
the executors are shut down. Note that the machine running the driver or
`spark-submit` needs to be reachable from the Nomad clients so that the
executors can connect to it.

In `client` mode, application resources need to start out present on the
submitting machine, so JAR files (both the primary JAR and those added with the
`--jars` option) can not be specified using `http:` or `https:` URLs. You can
either use files on the submitting machine (either as raw paths or `file:` URLs)
, or use `local:` URLs to indicate that the files are independently available on
both the submitting machine and all of the Nomad clients where the executors
might run.

In this mode, the `spark-submit` invocation doesn’t return until the application
has finished running, and killing the `spark-submit` process kills the
application.

In this example, the `spark-submit` command is used to run the `SparkPi` sample
application:

```shell
$ spark-submit --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \
    --master nomad \
    --conf spark.nomad.sparkDistribution=https://nomad-spark.s3.amazonaws.com/spark-2.1.0-bin-nomad.tgz \
    lib/spark-examples*.jar \
    10
```

## Cluster Mode

In cluster mode, the `spark-submit` process creates a Nomad job to run the Spark
application driver itself. The driver’s `SparkContext` then adds Spark executors
to the Nomad job. The executors connect to the driver and run Spark tasks on
behalf of the application. When the driver’s `SparkContext` is stopped, the
executors are shut down.

In cluster mode, application resources need to be hosted somewhere accessible
to the Nomad cluster, so JARs (both the primary JAR and those added with the
`--jars` option) can’t be specified using raw paths or `file:` URLs. You can either
use `http:` or `https:` URLs, or use `local:` URLs to indicate that the files are
independently available on all of the Nomad clients where the driver and executors
might run.

Note that in cluster mode, the Nomad master URL needs to be routable from both
the submitting machine and the Nomad client node that runs the driver. If the
Nomad cluster is integrated with Consul, you may want to use a DNS name for the
Nomad service served by Consul.

For example, to submit an application in cluster mode:

```shell
$ spark-submit --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \
    --master nomad \
    --deploy-mode cluster \
    --conf spark.nomad.sparkDistribution=http://example.com/spark.tgz \
    http://example.com/spark-examples.jar \
    10
```
