## AI Usage
Regardless of the tools used in the development process, maintaining the
stability and security of Nomad is our primary priority. If you choose to use AI
tools to assist in your contributions, we ask that you do so using the three
principles of transparency, accountability and quality to guide that work.

### Transparency
We value open communication about the tools and methods used to build Nomad. If
you utilize AI to generate code, documentation, or tests, please disclose this
in your Pull Request description.

- Be specific: Clearly state the role AI played in your submission (e.g., "Used
  to generate boilerplate for the new function," or "Used to refactor existing
  tests").

- Share the context: Where it adds clarity, share the process or prompts used.
  This helps reviewers understand the intent and verify the output effectively.

### Accountability
Understanding that AI usage can range along a spectrum from AI assistance to AI
led approaches we strongly prefer an approach that leaves the contributor in the
drivers seat. AI is a tool, not a seperate contributor. The responsibility for
changes submitted lies entirely with you, the human opening the PR.

- Human ownership: All PRs must be submitted by a real, human-owned account. We
  do not accept submissions from bot accounts used for code generation.

- Human review: We proceed with the assumption that every line of code has been
  reviewed by you. You must ensure that the code meets our quality standards,
  that edge cases are handled, and that appropriate tests are written and
  passing.

- Deep understanding: You must understand the submitted code deeply enough to
  explain it in your own words. If you cannot explain the logic, implications,
  or side effects of a change without relying on the AI's explanation, the PR is
  not ready for submission. You must own the PR.

### Quality
The bar for contributing to Nomad is high due to the complexity of the tool and
the critical workflows it supports. That same expectation of quality persists
regardless of the tools a contributor may or may not make use of.

- Assistance, not automation: AI should be used to assist your process, not to
  automate final decisions. It is easy for AI to generate plausible-looking but
  incorrect or dangerous code.
  
- Adherence to guidelines: We discourage low-effort submissions where AI output
  is pasted without refinement. We expect the same high quality, thoughtful
  architecture, and adherence to our existing style and testing guidelines as we
  do for manual code.
