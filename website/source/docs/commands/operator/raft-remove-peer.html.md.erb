# Command: operator raft remove-peer

Remove the Nomad server with given address from the Raft configuration.

There are rare cases where a peer may be left behind in the Raft quorum even
though the server is no longer present and known to the cluster. This command
can be used to remove the failed server so that it is no longer affects the Raft
quorum. If the server still shows in the output of the [`nomad
server members`](/docs/commands/server/members.html) command, it is preferable
to clean up by simply running [`nomad
server force-leave`](/docs/commands/server/force-leave.html) instead of this
command.

See the [Outage Recovery](/guides/operations/outage.html) guide for some examples of how
this command is used. For an API to perform these operations programmatically,
please see the documentation for the [Operator](/api/operator.html)
endpoint.
