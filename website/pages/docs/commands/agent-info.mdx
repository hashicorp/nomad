# Command: agent-info

The `agent-info` command dumps metrics and status information of a running
agent. The information displayed pertains to the specific agent the CLI
is connected to. This is useful for troubleshooting and performance monitoring.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad agent-info [options]
```

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the `agent:read`
capability.

## General Options

@include 'general_options_no_namespace.mdx'

## Output

Depending on the agent queried, information from different subsystems is
returned. These subsystems are described below:

- client - Status of the local Nomad client
- nomad - Status of the local Nomad server
- serf - Gossip protocol metrics and information
- raft - Status information about the Raft consensus protocol
- runtime - Various metrics from the runtime environment
