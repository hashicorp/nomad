#### Operation options

- `-var-file=<string>` - Specifies the path to a variable override file. This
  can be provided multiple times on a single command to result in a list of
  files.

- `-ignore-missing-vars` - Determines whether override variables not present in
  the pack should be ignored or produce an error.

- `-var=<key=value>` - Specifies single override variables in the form of HCL
  syntax and can be specified multiple times per command.

- `-name=<string>` - If set, this will be the unique identifier of this deployed
  instance of the specified pack. If not set, the pack name will be used. This
  is useful for running more than one instance of a pack within the same
  cluster. Note that this name must be globally unique within a cluster. Running
  the run command multiple times with the same name, will re-submit the same
  pack, and apply changes if you have made any to the underlying pack. Be
  mindful that, whether you have made changes or not, the underlying Allocations
  will be replaced. When managing packs, the name specified here is the name
  that should be passed to nomad-pack's `plan` and `destroy` commands.

- `-parser-v1` - Use the legacy syntax parser to parse your job. This enables
  pack to run packs for earlier versions while you are migrating them to the new
  syntax
