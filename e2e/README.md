# End to End Tests

This package contains integration tests.

The `terraform` folder has provisioning code to spin up a Nomad cluster on AWS.
The tests work with the `NOMAD_ADDR` environment variable which can be set
either to a local dev Nomad agent or a Nomad client on AWS.

## Local Development

The workflow when developing end to end tests locally is to run the
provisioning step described below once, and then run the tests as described
below.

When making local changes, use `./bin/update $(which nomad) /usr/local/bin/nomad`
and `./bin/run sudo systemctl restart nomad` to destructively modify the
provisioned cluster.

## Provisioning Test Infrastructure on AWS

You'll need Terraform and AWS credentials (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) to setup AWS instances on which e2e tests
will run. See the [README](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/blob/master/e2e/terraform/README.md)
for details. The number of servers and clients is configurable, as is
the configuration file for each client and server.

## Provisioning e2e Framework Nomad Cluster

You can use the Terraform output from the previous step to generate a
provisioning configuration file for the e2e framework.

```sh
# from the ./e2e/terraform directory
terraform output provisioning | jq . > ../provisioning.json
```

By default the `provisioning.json` will not include the Nomad version
that will be deployed to each node. You can pass the following flags
to `go test` to set the version for all nodes:

- `-nomad.local_file=string`: provision this specific local binary of
  Nomad. This is a path to a Nomad binary on your own
  host. Ex. `-nomad.local_file=/home/me/nomad`
- `-nomad.sha=string`: provision this specific sha from S3. This is a
  Nomad binary identified by its full commit SHA that's stored in a
  shared s3 bucket that Nomad team developers can access. That commit
  SHA can be from any branch that's pushed to
  remote. Ex. `-nomad.sha=0b6b475e7da77fed25727ea9f01f155a58481b6c`
- `-nomad.version=string`: provision this version from
  [releases.hashicorp.com](https://releases.hashicorp.com/nomad). Ex. `-nomad.version=0.10.2`

Then deploy Nomad to the cluster by passing `-provision.terraform`
without a Nomad version flag:

```sh
NOMAD_E2E=1 go test -v . -nomad.version=0.10.2 -provision.terraform ./provisioning.json -skipTests
```

Because it can take a little while for the cluster to settle, it's
recommended to run this provisioning step (with `-skipTests`) first,
and then run tests as separate step.

## Running

After completing the provisioning step above, you can set the client
environment for `NOMAD_ADDR` and run the tests as shown below:

```sh
# from the ./e2e/terraform directory, set your client environment
# if you haven't already
$(terraform output environment)

cd ..
go test -v .
```

If you want to run a specific suite, you can specify the `-suite` flag as
shown below. Only the suite with a matching `Framework.TestSuite.Component`
will be run, and all others will be skipped.

```sh
go test -v -suite=Consul .
```

If you want to run a specific test, you'll need to regex-escape some of the
test's name so that the test runner doesn't skip over framework struct method
names in the full name of the tests:

```sh
go test -v . -run 'TestE2E/Consul/\*consul\.ScriptChecksE2ETest/TestGroup'
```

## I Want To...

### ...SSH Into One Of The Test Machines

You can use the Terraform output to find the IP address. The keys will
in the `./terraform/keys/` directory.

```sh
ssh -i keys/nomad-e2e-*.pem ubuntu@${EC2_IP_ADDR}
```

### ...Deploy a Cluster of Mixed Nomad Versions

The `provisioning.json` file output by Terraform has a blank field for
`nomad_sha` for each node of the cluster (server and client). You can
manually edit the file to replace this value with a `nomad_sha`,
`nomad_local_binary`, or `nomad_version` for each node to create a
cluster of mixed versions. The provisioning framework accepts any of
the following options for those fields:

- `nomad_sha`: This is a Nomad binary identified by its full commit
  SHA that's stored in a shared s3 bucket that Nomad team developers
  can access. That commit SHA can be from any branch that's pushed to
  remote.  (Ex.  `"nomad_sha":
  "0b6b475e7da77fed25727ea9f01f155a58481b6c"`)
- `nomad_local_binary`: This is a path to a Nomad binary on your own
  host.  (Ex. `"nomad_local_binary": "/home/me/nomad"`)
- `nomad_version`: This is a version number of Nomad that's been
  released to HashiCorp. (Ex. `"nomad_version": "0.10.2"`)

Then deploy Nomad to the cluster by passing `-provision.terraform`
without a Nomad version flag:

```sh
go test -v . -provision.terraform ./provisioning.json -skipTests
```

### ...Deploy Custom Configuration Files

The `provisioning.json` file includes a `bundles` section for each
node of the cluster (server and client). You can manually edit this
file to add, remove, or replace

```json
"bundles": [
  {
    "destination": "/ops/shared/nomad/base.hcl",
    "source": "/home/me/custom.hcl"
  }
]
```

### ...Deploy More Than 4 Linux Clients

Right now the framework doesn't support this out-of-the-box because of
the way the provisioning script adds specific client configurations to
each client node (for constraint testing). You'll need to add
additional configuration files to
`./e2e/terraform/shared/nomad/indexed`.
