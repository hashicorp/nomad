# Workload Identity

When an [allocation][] is accepted by the [plan applier][], the leader generates
a Workload Identity for each task in the allocation. This workload identity is a
[JSON Web Token (JWT)][] that has been signed by the leader's keyring. The
workload identity includes the following identity claims:

```json
{
  "nomad_namespace": "default",
  "nomad_job_id": "example",
  "nomad_allocation_id": "5c6328f7-48c5-4d03-bada-91ef2e904d0d",
  "nomad_task": "web"
}
```

## Default Workload ACL Policy

By default, a Workload Identity has access to a implicit ACL policy. This policy
grants access to Nomad Variables associated with the job, group, and task, as
described in [Task Access to Variables][]. The implicit policy also allows
access to list or read any Nomad service registration as with the [List Services
API][] or [Read Service API][].

## Workload Associated ACL Policies

You can associate additional ACL policies with workload identities by passing
the `-job`, `-group`, and `-task` flags to `nomad acl policy apply`. When Nomad
resolves a workload identity claim, it will automatically include policies that
match. If no matching policies exist, the workload identity does not have any
additional capabilities.

For example, to allow a workload access to secrets from the namespace "shared",
you can create the following policy file:

```hcl
namespace "shared" {
  variables {
    path "*" {
      capabilities = ["read"]
    }
  }
}
```

You can then apply this policy to a specific task:

```shell-session
nomad acl policy apply \
   -namespace default -job example -group cache -task redis \
   redis-policy ./policy.hcl
```

You can also apply this policy to all tasks in the group by omitting the `-task`
flag:

```shell-session
nomad acl policy apply \
   -namespace default -job example -group cache \
   redis-policy ./policy.hcl
```

And you can apply this policy to all groups in the job by omitting both the
`-group` and `-task` flag:

```shell-session
nomad acl policy apply \
   -namespace default -job example \
   redis-policy ./policy.hcl
```

## Using Workload Identity

In Nomad 1.4.0 the workload identity is used only for `template`
access to [Variables][] and not exposed outside of Nomad.
