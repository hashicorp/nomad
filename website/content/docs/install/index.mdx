# Install Nomad

Nomad is available as a pre-compiled binary or as a package for several
operating systems. You can also [build Nomad from source](#from-source).

-> If you are interested in trialing Nomad without installing it locally, see
the [Quickstart](/nomad/docs/install/quickstart) for options to get started with
Nomad.

## Linux post-installation steps

These steps are optional but can be helpful for running Nomad and to
take advantage of additional Nomad functionalities.

-> You need to run client agents as root (or with `sudo`) so that cpuset accounting and network namespaces work correctly.

### Install CNI reference plugins

@include 'install/install-cni-plugins.mdx'

### Install consul-cni plugin

@include 'install/install-consul-cni-plugin.mdx'

### Install dmidecode

When running on a virtualized host such as Amazon EC2, Nomad makes use of the
`dmidecode` tool to detect CPU performance data. Some Linux distributions
require installing the dmidecode package manually.

### Configure bridge network to route traffic through iptables

@include 'install/bridge-iptables.mdx'

### Verify cgroup controllers

@include 'install/cgroup-controllers.mdx'


## Verify the Installation

To verify Nomad was installed correctly, try the `nomad` command.

```shell-session
$ nomad
```

You should see help output, similar to the following.

## Compiling from Source ((#from-source))

To compile from source, you will need [Go](https://golang.org) installed at the
version described by the [.go-version][go-version] file. You should properly
configure your Go environment, including setting a `GOPATH` environment variable
and ensuring `GOPATH/bin` is within your `PATH`. A copy of
[`git`](https://www.git-scm.com/) is also needed in your `PATH`.

1. Clone the Nomad repository from GitHub into your `GOPATH`:

   ```shell-session
   $ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp && cd $_
   $ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad.git
   $ cd nomad
   ```

1. Bootstrap the project. This will download and compile libraries and tools
   needed to compile Nomad:

   ```shell-session
   $ make bootstrap
   ```

1. Build Nomad for your current system and put the
   binary in `./bin/` (relative to the git checkout). The `make dev` target is
   just a shortcut that builds `nomad` for only your local build environment (no
   cross-compiled targets).

   ```shell-session
   $ make dev
   ```
