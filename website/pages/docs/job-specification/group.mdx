# `group` Stanza

<Placement groups={['job', 'group']} />

The `group` stanza defines a series of tasks that should be co-located on the
same Nomad client. Any [task][] within a group will be placed on the same
client.

```hcl
job "docs" {
  group "example" {
    # ...
  }
}
```

## `group` Parameters

- `constraint` <code>([Constraint][]: nil)</code> -
  This can be provided multiple times to define additional constraints.

- `affinity` <code>([Affinity][]: nil)</code> - This can be provided
  multiple times to define preferred placement criteria.

- `spread` <code>([Spread][spread]: nil)</code> - This can be provided
  multiple times to define criteria for spreading allocations across a
  node attribute or metadata. See the
  [Nomad spread reference](/docs/job-specification/spread) for more details.

- `count` `(int: 1)` - Specifies the number of the task groups that should
  be running under this group. This value must be non-negative.

- `ephemeral_disk` <code>([EphemeralDisk][]: nil)</code> - Specifies the
  ephemeral disk requirements of the group. Ephemeral disks can be marked as
  sticky and support live data migrations.

- `meta` <code>([Meta][]: nil)</code> - Specifies a key-value map that annotates
  with user-defined metadata.

- `migrate` <code>([Migrate][]: nil)</code> - Specifies the group strategy for
  migrating off of draining nodes. Only service jobs with a count greater than
  1 support migrate stanzas.

- `reschedule` <code>([Reschedule][]: nil)</code> - Allows to specify a
  rescheduling strategy. Nomad will then attempt to schedule the task on another
  node if any of the group allocation statuses become "failed".

- `restart` <code>([Restart][]: nil)</code> - Specifies the restart policy for
  all tasks in this group. If omitted, a default policy exists for each job
  type, which can be found in the [restart stanza documentation][restart].

- `shutdown_delay` `(string: "0s")` - Specifies the duration to wait when
  stopping a group's tasks. The delay occurs between Consul deregistration
  and sending each task a shutdown signal. Ideally, services would fail
  healthchecks once they receive a shutdown signal. Alternatively
  `shutdown_delay` may be set to give in flight requests time to complete
  before shutting down. A group level `shutdown_delay` will run regardless
  if there are any defined group services. In addition, tasks may have their
  own [`shutdown_delay`](/docs/job-specification/task#shutdown_delay)
  which waits between deregistering task services and stopping the task.

- `stop_after_client_disconnect` `(string: "")` - Specifies the
  duration to wait when the Nomad client is disconnected from the server
  after the [`heartbeat_grace`] window before terminating this group. By
  default, Nomad runs tasks indefinitely on clients even if the client
  has crashed or can't communicate with the server. After the
  [`heartbeat_grace`] window, the server marks allocations on the node
  as "lost" and reschedules them. But the task is left running on the
  client. For some workloads, operators may want to ensure that the
  allocations on the clients are also stopped (for example, they require
  exclusive access to an external resource). The group level
  `stop_after_client_disconnect` opts the group into being terminated.

- `task` <code>([Task][]: &lt;required&gt;)</code> - Specifies one or more tasks to run
  within this group. This can be specified multiple times, to add a task as part
  of the group.

- `vault` <code>([Vault][]: nil)</code> - Specifies the set of Vault policies
  required by all tasks in this group. Overrides a `vault` block set at the
  `job` level.

- `volume` <code>([Volume][]: nil)</code> - Specifies the volumes that are
  required by tasks within the group.

## `group` Examples

The following examples only show the `group` stanzas. Remember that the
`group` stanza is only valid in the placements listed above.

### Specifying Count

This example specifies that 5 instances of the tasks within this group should be
running:

```hcl
group "example" {
  count = 5
}
```

### Tasks with Constraint

This example shows two abbreviated tasks with a constraint on the group. This
will restrict the tasks to 64-bit operating systems.

```hcl
group "example" {
  constraint {
    attribute = "${attr.cpu.arch}"
    value     = "amd64"
  }

  task "cache" {
    # ...
  }

  task "server" {
    # ...
  }
}
```

### Metadata

This example show arbitrary user-defined metadata on the group:

```hcl
group "example" {
  meta {
    "my-key" = "my-value"
  }
}
```

### Stop on Client Disconnect

This example shows how `stop_on_client_disconnect` interacts with
other group stanzas. After the default 10 second [`heartbeat_grace`]
window expires, the server will reschedule both workloads. The client
will wait 90 seconds before sending a stop signal (`SIGTERM`) to the
`first` group. After 15 more seconds because of the `shutdown_delay`,
the client will send `SIGKILL`. The `second` group does not have
`stop_on_client_disconnect` and will not be stopped on the client no
matter how long the client is out of touch.

```hcl
group "first" {
  shutdown_delay = "15s"
  stop_after_client_disconnect = "90s"
}

group "second" {
  shutdown_delay = "5s"
}
```
