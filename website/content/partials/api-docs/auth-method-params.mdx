<!--
parameters for create/update auth method APIs
used in website/content/api-docs/acl/auth-methods.mdx
-->

- `Name` `(string: <required>)` - Name is the identifier of the ACL auth method.
The name can contain alphanumeric characters and dashes. This name must be
unique and must not exceed 128 characters.

- `Type` `(string: <required>)` - ACL auth method type, supports `OIDC` and
`JWT`.

- `TokenLocality` `(string: <required>)` - Defines whether the ACL auth method
creates a local or global token when performing SSO login. This field must be
set to either `local` or `global`.

- `TokenNameFormat` `(string <optional>)` - Defines the token name format for
the generated tokens This can be lightly templated using HIL `${foo}` syntax.
Defaults to `${auth_method_type}-${auth_method_name}`.

 - `MaxTokenTTL` `(duration: <required>)` - Defines the maximum life of a token
created by this method. When set, it will initialize the `ExpirationTime` field
on all tokens to a value of `Token.CreateTime + AuthMethod.MaxTokenTTL`. This
field is not persisted beyond its initial use. Can be specified in the form of
`"60s"` or `"5m"` (i.e., 60 seconds or 5 minutes, respectively).

- `Default` `(bool: false)` - Defines whether this ACL Auth Method is to be
set as default when running `nomad login` command.

- `Config` `(ACLAuthMethodConfig: <required>)` - The raw configuration to use
for the auth method.

  - `OIDCDiscoveryURL` `(string: <required>)` - The OIDC discovery URL, without
  any `.well-known` component (base path). Required for `OIDC` method type.
  Either this, the `JWKSURL` or the `JWTValidationPubKeys` is required for
  `JWT` method type.

  - `OIDCClientID` `(string: <required>)` - The OAuth client ID configured with
  your OIDC provider. Required for `OIDC` method type.

  - `OIDCClientSecret` `(string: <required>)` - The OAuth client secret
  configured with your OIDC provider. Required for `OIDC` method type.

  - `OIDCClientAssertion` `(OIDCClientAssertion)` - Optionally send a signed
  JWT ("[private key jwt][]") as a client assertion to the OIDC provider.
  Browse to the [OIDC concepts][concepts-assertions] page to learn more.

    - `Audience` `(array<string>)` - Who processes the assertion.
    Defaults to the parent `ACLAuthMethodConfig`'s `OIDCDiscoveryURL`

    - `KeySource` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies where to get the private
    key to sign the JWT.
    Available sources:
      - "nomad": Use current active key in Nomad's keyring
      - "private_key": Use key material in the `PrivateKey` field
      - "client_secret": Use the `OIDCClientSecret` inherited from the parent
      `ACLAuthMethodConfig` as an HMAC key

    - `KeyAlgorithm` `(string)` is the key's algorithm. Its default values are
    based on the `KeySource`:
      - "nomad": "RS256"; this is from Nomad's keyring and must not be changed
      - "private_key": "RS256"; must be RS256, RS384, or RS512
      - "client_secret": "HS256"; must be HS256, HS384, or HS512

    - `PrivateKey` `(OIDCClientAssertionKey)` - External key material to sign
    the JWT. `KeySource` must be "private_key" to enable this.

      - `PemKey` `(string)` - An RSA private key, in pem format. It is used to
      sign the JWT. Mutually exclusive with `PemKeyFile`.

      - `PemKeyFile` `(string)` - An absolute path to a private key on Nomad
      servers' disk, in pem format. It is used to sign the JWT.
      Mutually exclusive with `PemKey`.

      - `KeyIDHeader` `(string)` - Which header the provider uses to find
      the public key to verify the signed JWT.
      The default and allowed values depend on whether you set `KeyID`,
      `PemCert`, or `PemCertFile`. You must set exactly one of those options,
      so refer to them for their requirements.

      - `KeyID` `(string)` - Becomes the JWT's "kid" header.
      Mutually exclusive with `PemCert` and `PemCertFile`.
      Allowed `KeyIDHeader` values: "kid" (the default)

      - `PemCert` `(string)` - An x509 certificate, signed by the private key
      or a CA, in pem format. Nomad uses this certificate to derive an
      [x5t#S256][] (or [x5t][]) KeyID.
      Mutually exclusive with `PemCertFile` and `KeyID`.
      Allowed `KeyIDHeader` values: "x5t", "x5t#S256" (default "x5t#S256")

      - `PemCertFile` `(string)` - An absolute path to an x509 certificate on
      Nomad servers' disk, signed by the private key or a CA, in pem format.
      Nomad uses this certificate to derive an [x5t#S256][] (or [x5t][])
      header. Mutually exclusive with `PemCert` and KeyID.
      Allowed `KeyIDHeader` values: "x5t", "x5t#S256" (default "x5t#S256")

    - `ExtraHeaders` `(map[string]string)` - Added to the JWT headers,
    alongside "kid" and "type". Setting the "kid" header here is not allowed;
    use `PrivateKey.KeyID`.

  - `OIDCDisablePKCE` `(bool: false)` - When set to `true`, Nomad will not
  include [PKCE][] verification in the auth flow. Even with PKCE enabled in
  Nomad, which is the default setting, you may still need to enable it in the
  OIDC provider.

  - `OIDCDisableUserInfo` `(bool: false)` - When set to `true`, Nomad will not
  make a request to the identity provider to get OIDC UserInfo. You may wish to
  set this if your identity provider doesn't send any additional claims from the
  UserInfo endpoint.

  - `OIDCScopes` `(array<string>)` - List of OIDC scopes.

  - `JWTValidationPubKeys` `(array<string>)` - A list of PEM-encoded public keys
  to use to validate JWT signatures locally. Either this, the `JWKSURL` or the
  `OIDCDiscoveryURL` is required for `JWT` method type.

  - `JWKSURL` `(string)` - JSON Web Key Sets url for authenticating JWT
  signatures. Either this, the `JWTValidationPubKeys` or the
  `OIDCDiscoverURL` is required for `JWT` method type.

  - `BoundAudiences` `(array<string>)` - List of aud claims that are valid for
  login; any match is sufficient.

  - `BoundIssuer` `(array<string>)` - The value against which to match the iss
  claim in a JWT.

  - `AllowedRedirectURIs` `(array<string>)` - A list of allowed values for
  redirect_uri. Must be non-empty.

  - `DiscoveryCaPem` `(array<string>)` - PEM encoded CA certs for use by the TLS
  client used to talk with the OIDC discovery URL. If not set, system
  certificates are used.

  - `JWKSCACert` `(string)` - PEM encoded CA cert for use by the TLS client used
  to talk with the JWKS server.

  - `SigningAlgs` `(array<string>)` - A list of supported signing algorithms.
  Defaults to `RS256`.

  - `ExpirationLeeway` `(duration)` - Duration in seconds of leeway when
  validating expiration of a JWT to account for clock skew.

  - `NotBeforeLeeway` `(duration)` - Duration in seconds of leeway when
  validating not before values of a JWT to account for clock skew.

  - `ClockSkewLeeway` `(duration)` - Duration in seconds of leeway when
  validating all JWT claims to account for clock skew.

  - `ClaimMappings` `(map[string]string)` - Mappings of claims (key) that will
  be copied to a metadata field (value). Use this if the claim you are capturing
  is singular (such as an attribute).

  When mapped, the values in each list can be any of a number, string, or
  boolean and will all be stringified when returned.

  - `ListClaimMappings` `(map[string]string)` - Mappings of claims (key) will be
  copied to a metadata field (value). Use this if the claim you are capturing is
  list-like (such as groups).

  - `VerboseLogging` `(bool: false)` - When set to `true`, Nomad will log token
  claims, information related to binding-rule and role/policy evaluations,
  and client assertion JWTs, if applicable. Not recommended in production,
  since sensitive information may be present.
