# Command: volume delete

The `volume delete` command deletes external storage volumes with Nomad's
[Container Storage Interface (CSI)][csi] support. Only CSI plugins that
implement the [Controller][csi_plugins_internals] interface support this
command. The volume will also be [deregistered] when it is successfully
deleted.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad volume delete [options] [volume]
```

The `volume delete` command requires a single argument, specifying the ID of
volume to be deleted. The volume must still be [registered] with Nomad in
order to be deleted. Deleting will fail if the volume is still in use by an
allocation or in the process of being unpublished. If the volume no longer
exists, this command will silently return without an error.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the
`csi-write-volume` capability for the volume's namespace.
