# Key Management

Nomad servers maintain an encryption keyring used to encrypt [Secure
Variables][] and sign task [workload identities][]. The servers store key
metadata in raft, but the encryption key material is stored in a separate file
in the `keystore` subdirectory of the Nomad [data directory][]. These files have
the extension `.nks.json`.

Under normal operations the keyring is entirely managed by Nomad, but this
section provides administrators additional context around key replication and
recovery.

## Key Rotation

Only one key in the keyring is "active" at any given time, and all encryption
and signing operations happen on the leader. Nomad automatically rotates the
active encryption key every 30 days. When a key is rotated, the existing keys
are marked as "inactive" but not deleted, so they can be used for decrypting
previously encrypted variables and verifying workload identities for existing
allocations.

If you believe key material has been compromised, you can execute [`nomad
operator keyring secure-variables rotate -full`][]. A new "active" key will be
created and "inactive" keys will be marked "rekeying". Nomad will asynchronously
decrypt and re-encrypt all secure variables with the new key. As each key's
variables are encrypted with the new key, the old key will marked as
"deprecated".

## Key Replication

When a leader is elected, it creates the keyring if it does not already
exist. When a key is added, the metadata will be replicated via raft. Each
server runs a key replication process that watches for changes to the state
store and will fetch the key material from the leader asynchronously, falling
back to retrieving from other servers in the case where a key is written
immediately before a leader election.

## Restoring the Keyring from Backup

Key material is never stored in raft. This prevents an attacker with a backup of
the state store from getting access to encrypted secure variables. It also
allows the HashiCorp engineering and support organization to safely handle
cluster snapshots you might provide without exposing any of your keys or secure
variables.

However, this means that to restore a cluster from snapshot you need to also
provide the keystore directory with the `.nks.json` key files on at least one
server. Operators should include these files as part of your organization's
backup and recovery strategy for the cluster.
