# External Device Plugins

Nomad has a plugin system for defining task drivers. External device driver
plugins will have the same user experience as built in devices.

Below is a list of official external task drivers you can use with Nomad:

## Community Supported

If you have authored a device plugin that you believe will be useful to the
broader Nomad community and you are committed to maintaining the plugin,
please file a PR to add your plugin to this page. For details on authoring a
device plugin, please refer to the [plugin authoring guide][plugin_guide].
