# Command: deployment promote

The `deployment promote` command is used to promote task groups in a deployment.
Promotion should occur when the deployment has placed canaries for a task group
and those canaries have been deemed healthy. When a task group is promoted, the
rolling upgrade of the remaining allocations is unblocked. If the canaries are
found to be unhealthy, the deployment may either be failed using the "nomad
deployment fail" command, the job can be failed forward by submitting a new
version or failed backwards by reverting to an older version using the [`job
revert`](/docs/commands/job-revert.html) command.

## Usage

```
nomad deployment promote [options] <deployment id>
```

The `deployment promote` command requires a single argument, a deployment ID or
prefix. When run without specifying any groups to promote, the promote command
promotes all task groups. The group flag can be specified multiple times to
select particular groups to promote.

## General Options

<%= partial "docs/commands/_general_options" %>

## Promote Options

* `-group`: Group may be specified many times and is used to promote that
  particular group. If no specific groups are specified, all groups are
  promoted.

* `-detach`: Return immediately instead of monitoring. A new evaluation ID
  will be output, which can be used to examine the evaluation using the
  [eval-status](/docs/commands/eval-status.html) command

* `-verbose`: Show full information.

## Examples

Promote canaries in all groups:

```
# Have two task groups waiting for promotion.
