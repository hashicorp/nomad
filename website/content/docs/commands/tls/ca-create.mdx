# Command: nomad tls ca create

Create is used to create a self signed Certificate Authority to be used for Nomad TLS setup.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad tls ca create [options]
```

## CA Create Options

- `-additional-name-constraint=<value>` : Add name constraints for the CA.
  The server will reject certificates for DNS names other than those specified. Can be used
  multiple times. This option can only used in combination with `-name-constraint`.
- `common-name` : Common Name of CA. Defaults to `Nomad Agent CA`.
- `-days=<int>` : Provide number of days the CA is valid for from now on, defaults to 5 years.
- `-domain=<string>` : Domain of Nomad cluster. Only used in combination with
  `-name-constraint`. Defaults to `nomad`.
- `-name-constraint` : Add name constraints for the CA. Results in rejecting
  certificates for other DNS than specified. If turned on localhost and -domain
  will be added to the allowed DNS. If the UI is going to be served over HTTPS
  its DNS has to be added with `-additional-constraint`. It is not possible to
  add that after the fact. Defaults to false.


## Example

Create CA:

```shell-session
$ nomad tls ca create
==> CA Certificate saved to: nomad-agent-ca.pem
==> CA Certificate key saved to: nomad-agent-ca-key.pem
```

Create a CA with a specified domain:

```shell-session
$ nomad tls ca create -name-constraint="true" -domain="foo.com"
==> CA Certificate saved to: foo.com-agent-ca.pem
==> CA Certificate key saved to: foo.com-agent-ca-key.pem
```
