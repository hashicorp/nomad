# Tools

External tools provide additional capabilities and use cases to Nomad. They are
installed separately from Nomad itself and can sometimes be deployed as a Nomad
job in your cluster.

## HashiCorp-Maintained Tools

The following external tools are currently available for Nomad and maintained by HashiCorp:

- [Autoscaling](/tools/autoscaling) - HashiCorp's official Nomad Autoscaler. Supports scaling allocations within Nomad and scaling nodes on AWS, Azure, GCP, or arbitrary infrastructure via plugins.
- [Damon](https://github.com/hashicorp/damon) - An terminal dashboard for Nomad.
- [Levant](https://github.com/hashicorp/levant) - A templating and deployment tool for HashiCorp Nomad jobs that provides realtime feedback and detailed failure messages upon deployment issues.
- [Nomad Pack](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad-pack) - An official package manager and templating tool for Nomad, currently a Tech Preview.
- [OpenAPI](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad-openapi) - An OpenAPI/Swagger spec for Nomad, allowing for programmatic generation of SDKs and documentation. Includes a reference implementation in Go built on top of a generated client.
