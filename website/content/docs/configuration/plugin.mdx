# `plugin` Block

<Placement groups={['plugin']} />

The `plugin` block is used to configure plugins.

```hcl
plugin "example-plugin" {
    args = ["-my-flag"]
    config {
       foo = "bar"
       bam {
         baz = 1
       }
    }
}
```

The name of the plugin is the plugin's executable name relative to to the
[plugin_dir](/nomad/docs/configuration#plugin_dir). If the plugin has a
suffix, such as `.exe`, this should be omitted.

## `plugin` Parameters

- `args` `(array<string>: [])` - Specifies a set of arguments to pass to the
  plugin binary when it is executed.

- `config` `(hcl/json: nil)` - Specifies configuration values for the plugin
  either as HCL or JSON. The accepted values are plugin specific. Please refer
  to the individual plugin's documentation.
