# Nomad 1.10.x release notes

We are pleased to announce the following Nomad updates.

## Release highlights

### Dynamic host volumes

The dynamic host volumes feature brings a persistent storage option to your
workload allocations.

Nomad dynamic host volumes manage storage for stateful workloads without
requiring a restart of the Nomad nodes to apply configuration changes. You
create dynamic host volumes via the CLI or API and then configure the job with
the [`volume`](/nomad/docs/job-specification/volume) and
[`volume_mount`](/nomad/docs/job-specification/volume_mount) blocks in the job
specification.

Host volumes mount paths from the Nomad client into allocations. Nomad is aware
of host volume availability and makes use of it for job scheduling. However,
Nomad does not know about the volume's underlying characteristics, so you can
use host volumes for both local persistent storage and for highly
available networked storage.

Resources:

- [Host volumes section](/nomad/docs/operations/stateful-workloads#host-volumes)
  in the _Considerations for stateful workloads_ guide for an overview and
  comparison of storage options
- [Host volumes plugin
  specification](/nomad/docs/concepts/plugins/storage/host-volumes) for examples
  of how to write your own plugin to dynamically configure persistent storage on
  your Nomad client nodes
- [Use Nomad dynamic host volumes to persist data for stateful workloads
  tutorial](/nomad/tutorials/stateful-workloads/stateful-workloads-dynamic-host-volumes)
  to learn how to create and use a dynamic host volume for persistent storage


### OpenID Connect (OIDC) enhancements

Nomad 1.10 extends Nomad's OIDC SSO login feature with [Private Key JWT][pkjwt]
and [Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)][pkce].

#### Private Key JWT

Private Key JWT, also called client assertions, is a more secure alternative for
client secrets. Instead of sending a simple secret, Nomad builds a JWT and signs
it with a value that the OIDC provider verifies. In this approach, Nomad asserts
a valid OIDC client without sending any secret information over the network.

#### Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)

Nomad now enables PKCE by default for new or updated OIDC auth methods, which
brings extra security for both traditional client secrets and client assertions.
Existing auth methods remain unaffected until changed with one of the following:

- The [`nomad acl auth-method
  create`](/nomad/docs/commands/acl/auth-method/create) CLI command
- The [`nomad acl auth-method
  update`](/nomad/docs/commands/acl/auth-method/update) CLI command
- The [auth method API](/nomad/api-docs/acl/auth-methods)

Set the [`OIDCDisablePKCE`](/nomad/api-docs/acl/auth-methods#oidcdisablepkce)
option to turn off this extra security.

Note that although Nomad enables PKCE by default, some OIDC providers may
require you to also enable it in their configuration.

#### Resources

- [OIDC auth method guide][oidc-concepts] for details on using OIDC with Nomad
- [OIDC troubleshooting guide][oidc-trouble] to review common issues and tips
  for setting up OIDC
- [Authenticate users with SSO and Keycloak tutorial][oidc-tutorial] to
  configure Nomad and the Keycloak identity provider to automatically grant
  permissions in Nomad ACL.

### Container Storage Interface (CSI) enhancements

We added the following:

- CSI volume and plugin events to the event stream
- Volume capabilities to the `nomad volume status` command output
- The ability to use a volume ID prefix search and wildcard namespace with the
  [`nomad volume delete` command](/nomad/docs/commands/volume/delete). Refer to
  the [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/pull/24997) for
  details. Example usage:

  ```shell-session
  $ nomad volume create ./internal-plugin.volume.hcl
  ==> Created host volume internal-plugin with ID aeea91a0-06df-c16e-5403-ff82a2f28fd4
  ✓ Host volume "aeea91a0" ready

    2025-01-31T15:55:14-05:00
    ID        = aeea91a0-06df-c16e-5403-ff82a2f28fd4
    Name      = internal-plugin
    Namespace = default
    Plugin ID = mkdir
    Node ID   = b4611abd-d4a8-c83a-b05e-7d9f5b44a179
    Node Pool = default
    Capacity  = 0 B
    State     = ready
    Host Path = /run/nomad/dev/data/host_volumes/aeea91a0-06df-c16e-5403-ff82a2f28fd4

  $ nomad volume delete -type host aeea91a0
  Successfully deleted volume "aeea91a0-06df-c16e-5403-ff82a2f28fd4"!
  ```

### UI URL hints added to CLI commands

We added UI URL hints to the end of common CLI commands and a `-ui` flag to
automatically open the generated link in your browser.

Showing UI URL hints is enabled by default. You have two options for turning off
this feature:

- Server: Modify the [`show_cli_hints`
  parameter](/nomad/docs/configuration/ui#show_cli_hints) in your agent's `ui`
  block configuration.
- CLI: Set the `NOMAD_CLI_SHOW_HINTS` environment variable to `0` or `false`.

  ```shell-session
  $ nomad status
  No running jobs

  ==> View and manage Nomad jobs in the Web UI: https://localhost:4646/ui/jobs

  $ export NOMAD_CLI_SHOW_HINTS=0
  $ nomad status
  No running jobs
  ```
