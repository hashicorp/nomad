# Nomad Bench

The Nomad Bench project provides reusable infrastructure automation to run test scenarios in order
to collect metrics and data from Nomad clusters running at scale. The core goal of the project is
to achieve reproducible large scale test scenarios so we can better understand how Nomad scales
and uncover problems that are only detected in large cluster deployments. It is also used to
perform release soak testing, among other things.

The [repository][bench-repo] contains all the infrastructure and details to get started with your
own load testing.
