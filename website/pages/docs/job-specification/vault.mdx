# `vault` Stanza

<Placement
  groups={[
    ['job', 'vault'],
    ['job', 'group', 'vault'],
    ['job', 'group', 'task', 'vault']
  ]}
/>

The `vault` stanza allows a task to specify that it requires a token from a
[HashiCorp Vault][vault] server. Nomad will automatically retrieve a Vault token
for the task and handle token renewal for the task. If specified at the `group`
level, the configuration will apply to all tasks within the group. If specified
at the `job` level, the configuration will apply to all tasks within the job. If
multiple `vault` stanzas are specified, they are merged with the `task` stanza
taking the highest precedence, then the `group`, then the `job`.

```hcl
job "docs" {
  group "example" {
    task "server" {
      vault {
        policies = ["cdn", "frontend"]

        change_mode   = "signal"
        change_signal = "SIGUSR1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The Nomad client will make the Vault token available to the task by writing it
to the secret directory at `secrets/vault_token` and by injecting a `VAULT_TOKEN`
environment variable. If the Nomad cluster is [configured](/docs/configuration/vault#namespace)
to use [Vault Namespaces](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/enterprise/namespaces),
a `VAULT_NAMESPACE` environment variable will be injected whenever `VAULT_TOKEN` is set.

If Nomad is unable to renew the Vault token (perhaps due to a Vault outage or
network error), the client will attempt to retrieve a new Vault token. If successful, the
contents of the secrets file are updated on disk, and action will be taken
according to the value set in the `change_mode` parameter.

If a `vault` stanza is specified, the [`template`][template] stanza can interact
with Vault as well.

## `vault` Parameters

- `change_mode` `(string: "restart")` - Specifies the behavior Nomad should take
  if the Vault token changes. The possible values are:

  - `"noop"` - take no action (continue running the task)
  - `"restart"` - restart the task
  - `"signal"` - send a configurable signal to the task

- `change_signal` `(string: "")` - Specifies the signal to send to the task as a
  string like `"SIGUSR1"` or `"SIGINT"`. This option is required if the
  `change_mode` is `signal`.

- `env` `(bool: true)` - Specifies if the `VAULT_TOKEN` and `VAULT_NAMESPACE`
  environment variables should be set when starting the task.

- `policies` `(array<string>: [])` - Specifies the set of Vault policies that
  the task requires. The Nomad client will retrieve a Vault token that is
  limited to those policies.

## `vault` Examples

The following examples only show the `vault` stanzas. Remember that the
`vault` stanza is only valid in the placements listed above.

### Retrieve Token

This example tells the Nomad client to retrieve a Vault token. The token is
available to the task via the canonical environment variable `VAULT_TOKEN` and
written to disk at `secrets/vault_token`. The resulting token will have the
"frontend" Vault policy attached.

```hcl
vault {
  policies = ["frontend"]
}
```

### Signal Task

This example shows signaling the task instead of restarting it.

```hcl
vault {
  policies = ["frontend"]

  change_mode   = "signal"
  change_signal = "SIGINT"
}
```
