# `nomad operator root keyring remove` command reference

The `operator root keyring remove` command removes an encryption key from the
cluster. This operation may only be performed on keys that are not the active
key.

If ACLs are enabled, this command requires a management token.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad operator root keyring remove [options] <key ID>
```

The `key ID` must be the UUID. Use the `-verbose` option with the
[`nomad operator root keyring list`
command](/nomad/commands/operator/root/keyring-list) to fetch the key
UUID.

## Options

- `-force`: Remove the key even if it was used to sign an existing variable
or workload identity.


## Examples

```shell-session
$ nomad operator root keyring remove 48596ce5-3ff5-8f77-2dcf-301682ada0ce
error: Unexpected response code: 500 (active root key cannot be deleted - call rotate first)

$ nomad operator root keyring remove 33374156-9f81-b14c-83d4-a2f1f87dbf99
Removed encryption key 33374156-9f81-b14c-83d4-a2f1f87dbf99
