  Nomad can restart tasks if they have a failing health check based on

  running the task based on their `restart` policy.

# Check Restart Stanza

The [`check_restart` stanza][check restart] instructs Nomad when to restart tasks with unhealthy service checks.
When a health check in Consul has been unhealthy for the limit specified in a check_restart stanza,
it is restarted according to the task group's restart policy.

The `limit` field is used to specify the number of times a failing healthcheck is seen before local restarts are attempted.
Operators can also specify a `grace` duration to wait after a task restarts before checking its health.

We recommend configuring the check restart on services if its likely that a restart would resolve the failure. This
is applicable in cases like temporary memory issues on the service.

# Example

The following `check_restart` stanza waits for two consecutive health check failures with a
grace period and considers both `critical` and `warning` statuses as failures

```text
check_restart {
  limit           = 2
  grace           = "10s"
  ignore_warnings = false
}
```

The following CLI example output shows healthcheck failures triggering restarts until its
restart limit is reached.

```shell
$ nomad alloc status e1b43128-2a0a-6aa3-c375-c7e8a7c48690
