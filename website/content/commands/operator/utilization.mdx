# `nomad operator utilization` command reference

The `operator utilization` command allows Nomad Enterprise users to generate
utilization reporting bundles. If you have disabled [automated
reporting](/nomad/docs/enterprise/license/utilization-reporting), use
this command to manually generate the report and send it to HashiCorp. Nomad
takes a new snapshot when there are no snapshots from the past twenty-four
hours.

If ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the `operator:write`
capability.

<EnterpriseAlert />

## Options

- `-message` `(string; "")` - Provide context about the conditions under which
  the report was generated and submitted. This message is not included in the
  utilization bundle but is included in the Nomad server logs.

- `-output` `(string; "")` - Specifies the output path for the bundle. Defaults
  to a time-based generated file name in the current working directory.

- `-today-only` `(bool: false)` - Include snapshots from the previous 24 hours,
  not historical snapshots.

## Examples

Create a utilization reporting bundle that includes all persisted historical
snapshots and has the default bundle name
(`nomad-utilization-<time_stamp>.json`).

```shell-session
$ nomad operator utilization
Success! Utilization reporting bundle written to: nomad-utilization-2024-02-16T22-23-25Z.json
```

Create a utilization reporting bundle with a message about the bundle, and
output the file at the specified path, `/utilization/reports/latest.json`.

```shell-session
$ nomad operator utilization \
    -message="Change Control 654987" \
    -output="/utilization/reports/latest.json"
```

**Example output**

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
Success! Utilization reporting bundle written to: /utilization/reports/latest.json
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The message, `Change Control 654987`, is included in the _server log_, but not
in the bundle.

**Example entry in the server log**

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
[INFO]  reporting: reporting bundle generated: message="Change Control 654987"
```

</CodeBlockConfig>
