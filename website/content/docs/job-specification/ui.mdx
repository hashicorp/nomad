# `ui` Block

<Placement
  groups={[
    ['job', 'ui'],
  ]}
/>

The `ui` block provides options to modify the presentation of the Job index page
in the Web UI. When specified, a description and any number of links will be
added to the top of the job page in question.

The following will provide the Web UI with a job description and a pair of links:

## `ui` Parameters

- `description` `(string: "")` - The markdown-enabled description of the job. We
  support [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).
- `link` `(map<string|string>: nil)` - A link that should show up in the header
  of the job index page in the Web UI. A job can have any number of links, and
  they must contain both a string `label` and `url`.

## `ui` Example

```hcl
job "docs" {
  ui {
    description = "A job that uses **Nomad Variables**"
    link {
      label = "Learn more about Nomad"
      url   = "https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad"
    }
    link {
      label = "Nomad on GitHub"
      url   = "https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad"
    }
  }
  # ...
}
```
