  The /client endpoints are used to access client statistics and inspect
  allocations running on a particular client.

# Client HTTP API

The `/client` endpoints are used to interact with the Nomad clients.

Since Nomad 0.8.0, both a client and server can handle client endpoints. This is
particularly useful for when a direct connection to a client is not possible due
to the network configuration. For high volume access to the client endpoints,
particularly endpoints streaming file contents, direct access to the node should
be preferred as it avoids adding additional load to the servers.

When accessing the endpoints via the server, if the desired node is ambiguous
based on the URL, an additional `?node_id` query parameter must be provided to
disambiguate.

## Read Stats

This endpoint queries the actual resources consumed on a node. The API endpoint
is hosted by the Nomad client and requests have to be made to the nomad client
whose resource usage metrics are of interest.

| Method | Path            | Produces           |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/client/stats` | `application/json` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/api-docs#blocking-queries) and
[required ACLs](/api-docs#acls).

| Blocking Queries | ACL Required |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| `NO`             | `node:read`  |

### Parameters

- `node_id` `(string: <optional>)` - Specifies the node to query. This is
  required when the endpoint is being accessed via a server. This is specified as
  part of the URL. Note, this must be the _full_ node ID, not the short
  8-character one. This is specified as part of the path.
