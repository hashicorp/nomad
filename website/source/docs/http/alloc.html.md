### Field Reference

*   `TaskStates` - `TaskStates` is a map of tasks to their current state and the
    latest events that have effected the state.

    A task can be in the following states:

    * `TaskStatePending` - The task is waiting to be run, either for the first
      time or due to a restart.
    * `TaskStateRunning` - The task is currently running.
    * `TaskStateDead` - The task is dead and will not run again.

    <p>The latest 10 events are stored per task. Each event is timestamped (unix nano-seconds)
    and has one of the following types:</p>

    * `Setup Failure` - The task could not be started because there was a
      failure setting up the task prior to it running.
    * `Driver Failure` - The task could not be started due to a failure in the
      driver.
    * `Started` - The task was started; either for the first time or due to a
      restart.
    * `Terminated` - The task was started and exited.
    * `Killing` - The task has been sent the kill signal.
    * `Killed` - The task was killed by an user.
    * `Received` - The task has been pulled by the client at the given timestamp.
    * `Failed Validation` - The task was invalid and as such it didn't run.
    * `Restarting` - The task terminated and is being restarted.
    * `Not Restarting` - the task has failed and is not being restarted because it has exceeded its restart policy.
    * `Downloading Artifacts` - The task is downloading the artifact(s) specified in the task. 
    * `Failed Artifact Download` - Artifact(s) specified in the task failed to download.
    * `Restart Signaled` - The task was signalled to be restarted.
    * `Signaling` - The task was is being sent a signal.
    * `Sibling Task Failed` - A task in the same task group failed.
    * `Leader Task Dead` - The group's leader task is dead.
    * `Driver` - A message from the driver.
    * `Task Setup` - Task setup messages.

    Depending on the type the event will have applicable annotations.
