# Dynamic Application Sizing Nomad Task Target

<EnterpriseAlert>
  This functionality only exists in Nomad Autoscaler Enterprise. This is not
  present in the open source version of Nomad Autoscaler.
</EnterpriseAlert>

~> Note that currently Prometheus is the only APM availible for Dynamic Application Sizing

The `app-sizing-nomad` target plugin reports on the current task resource value
as well as submits recommendations to Nomad via the [recommendations API endpoint][nomad_recommendations_api]
based on the result of the Dynamic Application Sizing strategy calculations.

## Agent Configuration Options

The `app-sizing-nomad` plugin is automatically launched by Nomad Autoscaler
Enterprise and so the following setup is optional.

```hcl
target "app-sizing-nomad" {
  driver = "app-sizing-nomad"
}
```

## Policy Configuration Options

If using the [Nomad job specification scaling block][nomad_scaling_block] to
configure the scaling policy for a task resource, the following section can be
omitted as Nomad will populate them on job submission. Please also refer to the
[Nomad Autoscaler policy documentation][nomad_autoscaler_policy] for additional
detail and guidance.

```hcl
check "mem" {
  ...
  target "app-sizing-nomad" {
    Namespace = "default"
    Job       = "example"
    Group     = "cache"
    Task      = "Redis"
    Resource  = "MemoryMB"
  }
  ...
```

- `Region` `(string: "")` - The region in which the job resides as defined
  by the [`region` parameter][nomad_region_parameter] within the job specification.

- `Namespace` `(string: "")` - The namespace in which the job resides as defined
  by the [`namespace` parameter][nomad_namespace_parameter] within the job
  specification.

- `Job` `(string: "")` - The job identifier which contains the task group to
  scale as defined within the job specification [`job` block][nomad_job_block].

- `Group` `(string: "")` - The name of the task group to scale as defined in the
  job specification [`group` block][nomad_group_block].

- `Task` `(string: "")` - The name of the task to scale as defined in the job
  specification [`task` block][nomad_task_block].

- `Resource` `(string: "")` - The resource to scale as defined by the job
  specification [`resource` block][nomad_resource_block]. Supports either `CPU`
  or `MemoryMB`.
