# Dist

The `dist` folder contains sample configs for various platforms.

## Conventions

On unixes we will place agent configs under `/etc/nomad.d` and store
data under `/var/lib/nomad/`. You will need to create both of these
directories. We assume that `nomad` is installed to
`/usr/local/bin/nomad`.

## Agent Configs

The following example configuration files are provided:

- `server.hcl`
- `client.hcl`

Place one of these under `/etc/nomad.d` depending on the node's
role. You should use `server.hcl` to configure a node as a server
(which is responsible for scheduling) or `client.hcl` to configure a
node as a client (which is responsible for running workloads).

Read <https://nomadproject.io/docs/agent/configuration/index.html> to
learn which options are available and how to configure them.

## Systemd

On systems using systemd the basic systemd unit file under
`systemd/nomad.service` starts and stops the nomad agent. Place it
under `/etc/systemd/system/nomad.service`.

You can control Nomad with `systemctl start|stop|restart nomad`.

## Upstart

On systems using upstart the basic upstart file under
`upstart/nomad.conf` starts and stops the nomad agent. Place it under
`/etc/init/nomad.conf`.

You can control Nomad with `start|stop|restart nomad`.
