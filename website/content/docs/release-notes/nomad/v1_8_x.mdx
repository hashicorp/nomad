# Nomad 1.8.0

We are pleased to announce the following Nomad updates.

## Release highlights

- **Long Term Support Release (Enterprise):** Nomad 1.8 introduces a long
  term supported release which provides extended maintenance (two years of
  critical fixes provided through minor releases and efficient upgrades
  (support for direct upgrades from one LTS release to the next).

- **Exec2 Task Driver (beta):** The `exec2` driver is used to execute a
  command for a task. It offers a security model optimized for running
  'ordinary' processes with very low startup times and minimal overhead in
  terms of CPU, disk, and memory utilization. The `exec2` driver leverages
  kernel features such as the Landlock LSM, cgroups v2, and the unshare system
  utility. Due these enhancements, tasks no longer require leveraging
  filesystem isolation based on chroot, which provide an enhanced security
  profile and improved performance for the Nomad operator. Refer to [Exec2 Task
  Driver](/nomad/plugins/v1.8.x/drivers/exec2) for more details.
  
- **Transparent proxy support for Consul service mesh:** Transparent Proxy
  introduces a more seamless way of dialing upstream services when Consul service
  mesh is enabled. Users can configure services to use transparent proxy with a
  new [`transparent_proxy`](/nomad/docs/v1.8.x/job-specification/transparent_proxy)
  block. When a service is configured to use transparent proxy, workloads can now dial the 
  service using a virtual IP Consul DNS name.

- **Consul API Gateway for Nomad:** Consul API Gateway on Nomad is now
  officially supported. A prescriptive job specification on
  [hashicorp-guides/cnosul-api-gateway-on-nomad](https://github.com/hashicorp-guides/consul-api-gateway-on-nomad)
  along with a supporting [tutorial](/nomad/tutorials/integrate-consul/deploy-api-gateway-on-nomad) on
  how to securely deploy Consul API gateway on Nomad.

- **Sentinel policy management in the Web UI:** Enterprise users can manage
  Sentinel policies directly within the Nomad UI. Users can create a Sentinel
  policy based on a template provided from the UI or create policies directly
  using an editor for Sentinel policies. Refer to [Sentinel policies](/nomad/tutorials/governance-and-policy/sentinel)
  to learn more about how to use Sentinel within Nomad.

## What's deprecated

- **LXC Task driver:** The [Community LXC Task
  Driver](/nomad/plugins/drivers/community/lxc) is now deprecated. Official
  support will be removed and the repo will be archived when Nomad 1.9 is
  released. Users are encouraged to migrate their workloads to another task
  driver such as the built-in Docker task driver[/nomad/docs/drivers/docker].
  
- **ECS Task driver:** The remote [ECS Task
  Driver](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/plugins/drivers/remote/ecs) is
  now deprecated. Official support will be removed and the repo will be
  archived when Nomad 1.9 is released. Users are encouraged to migrate their
  workloads to Amazon ECS or to another Nomad task driver.
  
- **`stop_after_client_disconnect`, `max_client_disconnect`,
  `prevent_reschedule_on_lost`:** Nomad 1.8.0 introduces a [disconnect](/nomad/docs/job-specification/disconnect)
  block meant to group all the configuration options related to disconnected
  client's and server's behavior, causing the deprecation of the fields
  stop_after_client_disconnect, max_client_disconnect and
  prevent_reschedule_on_lost. This block also introduces new options for
  allocations reconciliation if the client regains connectivity.
  
  
## What's removed

- **raw_exec option `no_cgroups`:** In Nomad 1.7.0 the raw_exec plugin option
  for no_cgroups became ineffective. Starting in Nomad 1.8.0 attempting to set
  the no_cgroups in raw_exec plugin configuration will result in an error when
  starting the agent.
