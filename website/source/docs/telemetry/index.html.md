# Telemetry

The Nomad client and server agents collect a wide range of runtime metrics
related to the performance of the system. Operators can use this data to gain
real-time visibility into their cluster and improve performance. Additionally,
Nomad operators can set up monitoring and alerting based on these metrics in
order to respond to any changes in the cluster state.

Please refer to the documentation listed below or in the sidebar to learn more
about how you can leverage the telemetry Nomad exposes.
