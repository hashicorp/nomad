# Create and modify job versions

Nomad creates a new version for your job each time you run your job. A job can
have an unlimited number of versions, and version history is stored in state.
Over time, Nomad garbage collects dead versions that do not have a version tag. Saving a tag to a version prevents Nomad from garbage collecting that version.

This guide demonstrates the following job version features:

- Create, modify, and delete job version tags.
- Compare versions.
- Revert a running job to an older version, no matter how much time has passed.
- Clone a version.

## Prerequisites

- This feature requires Nomad v1.9.0 and later.
- You are familiar with [job versions and tags][job-concept].

## Create the `hello-world` job

The examples use a job named `hello-world`, which is one of Nomad's job
templates.

1. On the **Jobs** page, click **Run Job**.
1. Click **Choose from template**.
1. Select **Hello world**.
1. Click **Apply**.
1. Click **Plan**.
1. Review the **Job Plan** output.
1. Click **Run** to run the `hello-world` job.

## Create a version tag

When you create a version tag, you should provide Nomad with these attributes:

- A tag name
- A job name
- A version number

The following example creates a tag named `golden-version` for version zero of `hello-world`. It includes a description of the tag.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI">

Use the `nomad job tag apply [options] <job_id>` command to create a tag.

```shell-session
$ nomad job tag apply -version 0 -name "golden-version" \
    -description "The version we can roll back to." \
    hello-world

Job version 0 tagged with name "golden-version"
```

Note that Nomad tags the latest version if you omit the version number.

Refer to the [`job tag apply`][job-tag-apply-cli] command reference for details on
including general options such as `namespace`.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="API">

| Method | Path              | Produces           |
| ------ | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| `POST`  | `/v1/job/:job_id/versions/:tag_name/tag` | `application/json` |

This example assumes the Nomad API is accessible on `localhost:4646`.

```shell-session
$ curl -X POST \
 localhost:4646/v1/job/hello-world/versions/golden-version/tag \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
 '{"Version": 0, "Description": "The version we can roll back to."}'
```

The JSON response is similar to the following example.

```json
{
  "Name":"golden-version",
  "Description":"The version we can roll back to.",
  "TaggedTime":1728325495829793000,
  "Index":361,
  "LastContact":0,
  "KnownLeader":false,
  "NextToken":""}
```

Refer to the Jobs HTTP API [Create Job Version Tag][job-tag-apply-api] reference for
details on path and payload parameters.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Web UI">

1. From the **Jobs** screen, click the **hello-world** job to display job details.
1. Click **Versions**.
1. Find **Version #0** in the list.
1. Click **Tag this version**.
1. Enter `golden version` in the **Tag Name** field and `The version we can roll
   back to.` in the **Tag Description** field.
1. Click **Save**.

Version zero now has a `golden-version` tag.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

Using the CLI, you can run a new version of your job and create a tag for that
new version. The following example runs a new version of the hello-world job and
immediately tags that version.

```shell-session
$ nomad job run hello-world.nomad.hcl && \
  nomad job tag apply -name "high-traffic-version" hello-world

## Compare versions

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI">

Use the [`nomad job history -p` command][nomad-job-history-cli] to compare
different job versions. The `-p` option displays the differences between each
version and the most recent version. You also have these options:

- `-diff-version`: Specifies the version number of the job to compare against.
    Mutually exclusive with the `-diff-tag` flag.
- `-diff-tag`: Specifies the version of the job to compare against, referenced
  by tag name. Defaults to the latest version. Mutually exclusive with `-diff-version`.

### Show diff based on a version

The `nomad job history -p -diff-version <job_id>` command compares all
versions against the specified `diff-version`.

The following example compares all job versions to version 4.

```shell-session
$ nomad job history -p -diff-version=4 hello-world
```

You can also perform a diff between two specific versions. This example compares
 version 4 of the hello-world job with version 1 of the job.

```shell-session
$ nomad job history -p -version=4 -diff-version=1 hello-world
```

### Show diff based on a tag

The `nomad job history -p -diff-tag <job_id>` command compares all
versions against the specified `diff-tag`.

The following example compares all job versions to the version tagged with the name `golden-version`.

```shell-session
$ nomad job history -p -diff-tag="golden-version" hello-world
```

You can also perform a diff between a tag and a version number. The following
example compares the current version, `-version=4`, with the version tagged
`golden-version`.

```shell-session
$ nomad job history -p -version=4 -diff-tag="golden-version" hello-world

Version     = 4
Stable      = true
Submit Date = 2024-10-08T14:42:30-05:00
Tag Name    = high-traffic-version
Diff        =
+/- Job: "hello-world"
+/- Task Group: "servers"
  +   Network {
        Hostname: ""
        Mode:     ""
      + Dynamic Port {
        + HostNetwork: "default"
        + Label:       "www"
        + To:          "8002"
        }
      }
  -   Network {
        Hostname: ""
        Mode:     ""
      - Dynamic Port {
        - HostNetwork: "default"
        - Label:       "www"
        - To:          "8001"
        }
      }
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="API">

You can get a version list with the `Diffs` field populated. To compare all
versions to a specific version, use the `diff_version` query parameter.

This example compares all versions to version one.

```shell-session
$ curl -X GET \
  localhost:4646/v1/job/hello-world/versions?diffs=true&diff_version=1
```

Refer to the Jobs HTTP API [List Job Versions][job-list-diff-api] reference for
details and complete examples.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Web UI">

The job detail's **Versions** tab shows the list of versions.

![Version diff features](/img/nomad/job-version-tag/nomad-ui-version-diff.png)

The two important elements are the **Diff against** dropdown, labeled "1", and
the changes show or hide toggle, labeled "2".

The **Diff against** dropdown contains versions or tags that change how the UI
compares the versions against each other.

![Version diff dropdown items](/img/nomad/job-version-tag/nomad-ui-diff-dd.png)

The **Diff against previous version** option means that each version displays
the difference with the previous version in the list. The **See Change**
toggle displays the number of changes. Click the **See Change** arrow
to review the actual difference.

![Version diff previous](/img/nomad/job-version-tag/nomad-ui-diffs-expanded.png)

When you select a version or tag, the UI
automatically displays the differences each version has with the selected
version.

## Revert to a version

Use job tags to revert the current running job to a prior version.

The following examples revert versions of the `hello-world` job to specific version number or tag names.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI">

Use the `nomad job revert [options] <job_id> <version|tag>` command to revert
the current job to a prior version.

This example reverts the job to version three.

```shell-session
$ nomad job revert hello-world 3
```

This example reverts the job to the version with the `golden-version` tag.

```shell-session
$ nomad job revert hello-world "golden-version"
```

Refer to the [`job revert`][job-revert-cli] command reference for more examples
as well as details on including general options such as namespace.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="API">

| Method | Path                     | Produces           |
| ------ | ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| `POST` | `/v1/job/:job_id/revert` | `application/json` |

You can revert a job to a previous version by specifying version number or the
tag name.

This example reverts the current job to version six.

```shell-session
$ curl -X POST \
 localhost:4646/v1/job/hello-world/revert \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
 '{"JobID": "hello-world", "JobVersion": 6}'
```

This example reverts the current job to the version tagged `golden-version`.

```shell-session
$ curl -X POST \
 localhost:4646/v1/job/hello-world/revert \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
 '{"JobID": "hello-world", "TaggedVersion": "golden-version"}'
```

The JSON response for both examples is similar to the following.

```json
{
  "EvalID":"c3b8b0b1-85b5-34f9-de70-80d859c6466a",
  "EvalCreateIndex":6442,
  "JobModifyIndex":6442,
  "Warnings":"",
  "Index":6442,
  "LastContact":0,
  "KnownLeader":false,
  "NextToken":""
}
```

Refer to the Jobs HTTP API [Revert to older Job Version][job-revert-api]
reference for details on path and payload parameters.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Web UI">

In this example, you revert the current job to the version with the
`golden-version` tag.

![Revert job](/img/nomad/job-version-tag/nomad-ui-revert-job.png)

1. From the **Jobs** screen, click the **hello-world** job to display job details.
1. Click **Versions**.
1. Find the version with the `golden-version` tag.
1. Click **Revert Version**. The UI asks you to confirm.
1. Click **Yes, Revert Version** to complete the reversion process.

The UI then displays the **Overview** tab, where you can review the new version deployment.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Clone a version

Use the web UI to clone a job version.

You can use a cloned version for a new version of the same job or to create a new job.

### Clone as new version

In this example, you clone the `hello-world` job's `golden-version`, edit the
job spec, plan, and then run the new version.

1. From the **Jobs** screen, click the **hello-world** job to display job details.
1. Click the **Versions** tab.
1. Under the version with the `golden-version` tag, click **Clone and Edit**.
1. Click **Clone as New Version of hello-world**.
1. Edit the job definition.

   Since this job spec was created using HCL, the UI displays the definition in the **Job Spec** tab.

   Change the network port to `8080`.

   <Warning>
   If you choose to edit the JSON in the <strong>Full Definition</strong> tab,
   the JSON definition replaces the HCL definition, so you lose the HCL
   job spec.
   We recommending using HCL for job specs.
   </Warning>

1. Click **Plan**.
1. Review the plan output.
1. Click **Run** to run the new version.

The **Versions** tab displays the new version.

### Clone as new job

In this example, you clone the `hello-world` job's `golden-version`, edit the
job name and network port, plan, and then run the new job.

1. From the **Jobs** screen, click the **hello-world** job to display job details.
1. Click the **Versions** tab.
1. Under the version with the `golden-version` tag, click **Clone and Edit**.
1. Click **Clone as New Job**.
1. Edit the job spec.

   Change the job name to `hello-earth` and the network port to `9080`. You must change the job name. Otherwise, Nomad creates a new version of the
   original job.

1. Click **Plan**.
1. Review the plan output.
1. Click **Run** to run the new job.

Nomad loads the **Overview** of the `hello-earth` job so you can review the deployment.
