If you use the `transparent_proxy` block for Consul Service Mesh, then you must install the 
`consul-cni` plugin on each client node to redirect inbound and outbound traffic for services to the Envoy proxy. Install the reference CNI plugins before you install the Consul CNI plugin. The following commands assume that the reference CNI plugins have already been installed. 

Install the `consul-cni` plugin on each client node.

```shell-session
$ export ARCH_CNI=$( [ $(uname -m) = aarch64 ] && echo arm64 || echo amd64)
$ curl -L -o consul-cni.zip "https://releases.hashicorp.com/consul-cni/1.5.1/consul-cni_1.5.1_linux_${ARCH_CNI}".zip && \
  sudo unzip consul-cni.zip -d /opt/cni/bin -x LICENSE.txt
```
