# HCL2 <sup>Beta</sup>

~~> **NOTE:** This page is about Nomad 1.0 Beta. Details are subject to change before final release.

Nomad 1.0 adopts
[HCL2](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl2/blob/master/README.md), the second
generation of HashiCorp Configuration Language. HCL2 extends the HCL language by
adding expressions and input variables support that improves Job Spec
reusability and readability. Also, the new HCL2 parser improves the error
messages for invalid jobs.

## Expressions

Nomad 1.0 supports expressions and built-in functions, allowing for a more concise job spec. HCL2 allows use of the following expressions:

* value literals: e.g. `42`, `"hello"`, `true`
* arithmetic expression: `5*100`
* for-each expressions: `[for s in [3, 4, 5]: s+1]` (which evaluates to `[4, 5, 6]`)
* invocation of function calls: `upper("FOO")`.

For a full list of available functions, see [the function reference](https://www.packer.io/docs/from-1.5/expressions).

The following snippet illustrates the power of expressions and built-in functions:
```hcl
template {
  # `file` function can load external files without embedding them in the jobspec file
  data        = file("scripts.sh")
  destination = "local/scripts.sh"
}

template {
  # jsonencode eases maintaining json field
  data        = jsonencode({ regions = { tokyo = 4, mumbai = 2, us_east = 3 }})
  destination = "local/region_mapping.json"
}

resources {
  # arithmetics can make values more obvious
  memory = 2 * 1014
}
```

## Input Variables

Input variables serve as parameters for Nomad jobs, allowing reuse of the job spec
to target multiple environments or contexts without altering the job spec source.

Input variables don't need to be explicitly declared, and can be referenced
within expressions as `vars.<NAME>`. You can set the variable in the CLI by
passing `-var <NAME>=<VALUE>`.

For example, to reprpose the job spec to target different environments (e.g.
staging vs production), you can use `vars.environment` in the job spec, and pass
`--var environment=production`.

## Backward Compatibilities

HCL2 syntax closely mirrors HCL1, but has some minor changes. For most Nomad users, existing job
specification will require no changes at all.

If the configuration requires an update, the CLI will report the required
changes. Also, the operator can activate a backward compatibility mode by
passing `-hcl1`, for Nomad to use the HCL1 parser instead.

### Blocks

Nomad 0.12 and earlier allowed few variations for defining blocks. For example, the following variations of `meta` were accepted:
```hcl
meta {
  # meta attributes can be quoted or not
  "team"       = "..."
  organization = "..."
}

# meta can be an assignment to a map
meta = { "team" = "...", organization = "..." }
```

Starting with Nomad 1.0, only the block syntax with unquoted attributes is accepted:

```hcl
meta {
  team         = "..."
  organization = "..."
}
```
