Starting in v0.7, the Nomad UI is accessible at `/ui`. It is not namespaced by version. A request to `/`
will also redirect to `/ui`.

placements, healthy and unhealthy allocations, as well the current description for the
status. A table of task groups is also present in the detail view, which shows allocation
metrics by task group. Lastly, each expanded deployment lists all associated allocations
in a table to drill into for task events.

## ACL Tokens

This page lets you enter an ACL token (both accessor ID and secret ID) to use with the UI.
If the cluster does not have ACLs enabled, this page is unnecessary. If the cluster has an
anonymous policy that grants cluster-wide read access, this page is unnecessary. If the
anonymous policy only grants partial read access, then providing an ACL Token will
authenticate all future requests to allow read access to additional resources.
