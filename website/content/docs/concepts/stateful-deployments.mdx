# Stateful deployments

<Note>

Stateful deployments support only dynamic host volumes. For CSI volumes, use the
[`per_alloc` property](/nomad/docs/job-specification/volume#per_alloc), 
which serves a similar purpose.

</Note>

Nomad stateful deployments let you effectively bind your jobs to host [volumes].
On a lower level, this means taking Nomad's basic unit of workload placement,
the [allocation], and making it possible for you to have allocations that are
[sticky] to volume IDs. Since stateful deployments only support dynamic host
volumes, using them effectively means binding a job to a particular node.

Stateful deployments work on a per-task-group basis. Use the `volume.sticky` parameter in your job specification to indicate that each task group requires a sticky host volume.

This example sets the volume's `sticky` parameter to `true`.

```hcl
job "app" {
  group "example" {
    # ...
    volume "example" {
      type      = "host"
      source    = "ca-certificates"
      read_only = true
      sticky    = true
    }
    # ...
  }
}
```

If you set the volume to sticky, during the deployment the scheduler
associates its ID with the task group that uses it. Stateful deployments require
that any allocations belonging to that task group must be places or replaced on
nodes that have this volume ID available.

Scaling jobs with sticky volumes up results in more volume IDs claimed by the
task group, but scaling jobs down does not delete unused volumes, nor does it
touch the data present on them.

If the scheduler cannot find a node that has the right volume ID present,
perhaps because the node is down or disconnected, Nomad creates a blocked evaluation.
