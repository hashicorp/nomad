# `reporting` Block

<Placement groups={['reporting']} />

The `reporting` block configures the Nomad agents automated license utilization
reporting. This is an Enterprise-only feature and the configuration applies to
agents running with [server mode enabled][server_mode_enabled].

For more information about automated license utilization reporting, please see the
[guide][automated_license_utilization_reporting].

```hcl
reporting {
  license {
    enabled = true
  }

  snapshot_retention_time = "9600h"
}
```

## `reporting` Parameters

- `license` <code>([license](#license-block): default)</code> - Configures
  automated license utilization reporting.

- `snapshot_retention_time` `(string: "9600h")` - Configures the maximum amount
  of time that Nomad retains a utilization reporting snapshot in the Nomad
  state store. You can export these snapshots with the [`nomad operator
  utilization`][] command.

- `disable_product_usage_reporting` `(bool: false)` - Specifies whether detailed
  product usage metrics should be disabled. Review the
  [full list of metrics](/nomad/docs/enterprise/license/utilization-reporting#full-list-of-metrics)
  before disabling this option, and share any concerns you may have
  with your account manager.

## `license` Block

- `enabled` `(bool: true)` - Specifies whether automated license utilization
  reporting should be enabled and run. License utilization metrics are still
  gathered for offline reporting.
