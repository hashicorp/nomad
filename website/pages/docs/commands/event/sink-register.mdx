# Command: event sink register

The `event sink register` command is used to register an event sink.
Registering an event sink will add the event sink to Nomad. Nomad will send
events that match the event sink topics to the event sink.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad event sink register <path>
```

The `event sink register` command requires a single argument, a path to a file
with the JSON configuration for an event sink. "-" can be given as the path to
provide the configuration via stdin.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a management token.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Example

Register an event sink:

```shell-session
$ cat event.json
{
  "ID": "all-deployments-webhook",
  "Address": "http://127.0.0.1",
  "Topics": {
    "Deployments": ["*"]
  },
  "Type": "webhook"
}
$ nomad event sink register event.json
Successfully registered "all-deployments-webhook" event sink!
```
