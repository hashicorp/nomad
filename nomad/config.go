	// longer than the initial delay as the purpose it severs is to apply
	// back-pressure as evaluatiions are being Nacked either due to scheduler

	MinHeartbeatTTL time.Duration

	// MaxHeartbeatsPerSecond is the maximum target rate of heartbeats
	// being processed per second. This allows the TTL to be increased
	// to meet the target rate.
	MaxHeartbeatsPerSecond float64

	// HeartbeatGrace is the additional time given as a grace period
	// beyond the TTL to account for network and processing delays
	// as well as clock skew.
	HeartbeatGrace time.Duration
