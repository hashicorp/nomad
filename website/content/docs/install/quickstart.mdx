# Quickstart

This page lists multiple methods to installing Nomad locally or in a sandbox
environment.

These installations are designed to get you started with Nomad easily and should
be used only for experimentation purposes. If you are looking to install Nomad
in production, please refer to the [Production Installation](/nomad/docs/install/production) guide here.

## Install Nomad on your machine

If you would like to try Nomad locally, you can install Nomad on your local
machine using the same steps that you would for a production environments and
run a single-node development instance using the `sudo nomad agent -dev` command

[Installing Nomad][installing-binary]

-> **Note:** If you are using Docker Desktop for Windows or MacOS, please check
[our FAQ][faq-win-mac].

## Run Nomad in Vagrant

Alternatively, you can use a Vagrant to set up a development environment for Nomad.
Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments.

-> **Note**: To use the Vagrant environment, first install Vagrant following
these [instructions](/vagrant/docs/installation). You will
also need a virtualization tool, such as [VirtualBox][].

You can download a Vagrantfile which can start a small Nomad cluster. First
create a new directory for your Vagrant environment.

```shell-session
$ mkdir nomad-vagrant
```

Change into the directory you made with the previous command.

```shell-session
$ cd nomad-vagrant
```

Now you can get the Nomad installation configuration.

```shell-session
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hashicorp/nomad/master/demo/vagrant/Vagrantfile
```

Now that you have created a new directory and downloaded the `Vagrantfile`
you must create the virtual machine with the `vagrant up` command.

```shell-session
$ vagrant up
```

This takes a few minutes as the base Ubuntu box must be downloaded
and provisioned with both Docker and Nomad. Once this completes, you should
see this output.

```plaintext
Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
==> default: Importing base box 'bento/ubuntu-18.04'...
...
==> default: Running provisioner: docker...
```

At this point the Vagrant box is running and ready to go.
