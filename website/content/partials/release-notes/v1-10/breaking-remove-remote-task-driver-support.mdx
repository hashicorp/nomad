#### Remote task driver support removed

In Nomad 1.10.0, we removed all support for remote task driver
capabilities. Nomad no longer detaches drivers with the `RemoteTasks` capability
when an allocation is lost. Also, Nomad does not detach remote tasks
when a node is drained. Workloads running as remote tasks should be migrated
prior to upgrading.
