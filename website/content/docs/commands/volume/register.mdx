# Command: volume register

The `volume register` command registers external storage volumes with Nomad's
[Container Storage Interface (CSI)][csi] support. The volume must exist on the
remote storage provider before it can be registered and used by a task.

CSI plugins that implement the [Controller][csi_plugins_internals] interface
can be created via the [`volume create`] command, which will automatically
register the volume as well.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad volume register [options] [file]
```

The `volume register` command requires a single argument, specifying the path
to a file containing a valid [volume
specification][volume_specification]. This file will be read and the job will
be submitted to Nomad for scheduling. If the supplied path is "-", the job
file is read from STDIN. Otherwise it is read from the file at the supplied
path.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the
`csi-write-volume` capability for the volume's namespace.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Volume Specification

The file may be provided as either HCL or JSON. An example HCL configuration:

```hcl
id              = "ebs_prod_db1"
name            = "database"
type            = "csi"
external_id     = "vol-23452345"
plugin_id       = "ebs-prod"
snapshot_id     = "snap-12345" # or clone_id, see below
capacity        = "100G"
access_mode     = "single-node-writer"
attachment_mode = "file-system"

mount_options {
  fs_type     = "ext4"
  mount_flags = ["ro"]
}

secrets {
  example_secret = "xyzzy"
}

parameters {
  skuname = "Premium_LRS"
}

context {
  endpoint = "http://192.168.1.101:9425"
}
```

## Volume Specification Parameters

- `id` `(string: <required>)` - The unique ID of the volume. This is how the
  [`volume.source`][csi_volume_source] field in a job specification will refer
  to the volume.

- `name` `(string: <required>)` - The display name of the volume.

- `type` `(string: <required>)` - The type of volume. Currently only `"csi"`
  is supported.

- `external_id` `(string: <required>)` - The ID of the physical volume from
  the storage provider. For example, the volume ID of an AWS EBS volume or
  Digital Ocean volume.

- `plugin_id` `(string: <required>)` - The ID of the [CSI plugin][csi_plugin]
  that manages this volume.

- `snapshot_id` - This field is only used during volume creation, and is
  ignored during volume registration. See [`volume create`].

- `clone_id` - This field is only used during volume creation, and is ignored
  during volume registration. See [`volume create`].

- `capacity_min` - This field is only used during volume creation, and is
  ignored during volume registration. See [`volume create`].

- `capacity_max` - This field is only used during volume creation, and is
  ignored during volume registration. See [`volume create`].

- `capability` - This field is only used during volume creation, and is
  ignored during volume registration. See [`volume create`].

- `mount_options` - This field is only used during volume creation, and is
  ignored during volume registration. See [`volume create`].

- `secrets` <code>(map<string|string>:nil)</code> - An optional
  key-value map of strings used as credentials for publishing and
  unpublishing volumes.

- `parameters` <code>(map<string|string>:nil)</code> - An optional
  key-value map of strings passed directly to the CSI plugin to
  configure the volume. The details of these parameters are specific
  to each storage provider, so please see the specific plugin
  documentation for more information.

- `context` <code>(map<string|string>:nil)</code> - An optional
  key-value map of strings passed directly to the CSI plugin to
  validate the volume. The details of these parameters are specific to
  each storage provider, so please see the specific plugin
  documentation for more information.
