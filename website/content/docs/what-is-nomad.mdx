# Introduction to Nomad

Welcome to the intro guide to Nomad. This guide is the best place to start with Nomad. We cover what Nomad is, what problems it can solve, how it compares to existing software, and how you can get started using it. If you are familiar with the basics of Nomad, the [documentation](/nomad/docs) and [tutorials](/nomad/tutorials) provide a more detailed reference of available features.

## What is Nomad?

Nomad is a flexible workload orchestrator that enables an organization to easily deploy and manage any containerized or legacy application using a single, unified workflow. Nomad can run a diverse workload of Docker, non-containerized, microservice, and batch applications.

Nomad enables developers to use declarative infrastructure-as-code for deploying applications. Nomad uses bin packing to efficiently schedule jobs and optimize for resource utilization. Nomad is supported on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

Nomad is widely adopted and used in production by PagerDuty, Target, Citadel, Trivago, SAP, Pandora, Roblox, eBay, Deluxe Entertainment, and more.

## Key features

- **Deploy Containers and Legacy Applications**: Nomadâ€™s flexibility as an orchestrator enables an organization to run containers, legacy, and batch applications together on the same infrastructure. Nomad brings core orchestration benefits to legacy applications without needing to containerize via pluggable [task drivers](/nomad/docs/drivers).

- **Simple & Reliable**: Nomad runs as a single binary and is entirely self contained - combining resource management and scheduling into a single system. Nomad does not require any external services for storage or coordination. Nomad automatically handles application, node, and driver failures. Nomad is distributed and resilient, using leader election and state replication to provide high availability in the event of failures.

- **Device Plugins & GPU Support**: Nomad offers built-in support for GPU workloads such as machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Nomad uses [device plugins](/nomad/plugins/devices) to automatically detect and utilize resources from hardware devices such as GPU, FPGAs, and TPUs.

- **Federation for Multi-Region**: Nomad has native support for multi-region federation. This built-in capability allows multiple clusters to be linked together, which in turn enables developers to deploy jobs to any cluster in any region. Federation also enables automatic replication of ACL policies, namespaces, resource quotas and Sentinel policies across all clusters.

- **Proven Scalability**: Nomad is optimistically concurrent, which increases throughput and reduces latency for workloads. Nomad has been proven to scale to clusters of 10K+ nodes in real-world production environments.

- **HashiCorp Ecosystem**: Nomad integrates seamlessly with Terraform, Consul, Vault for provisioning, service discovery, and secrets management.

## How Nomad compares to other tools

The following characteristics generally differentiate Nomad from related products:

- **Simplicity**: Nomad runs as a single process with zero external
  dependencies. Operators can easily provision, manage, and scale Nomad.
  Developers can easily define and run applications.
- **Flexibility**: Nomad can run a diverse workload of containerized, legacy,
  microservice, and batch applications. Nomad can schedule service, batch
  processing and system jobs, and can run on both Linux and Windows.
- **Scalability and High Performance**: Nomad can schedule thousands of
  containers per second, scale to thousands of nodes in a single cluster, and
  easily federate across regions and cloud providers.
- **HashiCorp Interoperability**: Nomad elegantly integrates with Vault for
  secrets management and Consul for service discovery and dynamic configuration.
  Nomad's Consul-like architecture and Terraform-like job specification lower
  the barrier to entry for existing users of the HashiCorp stack.

There are many relevant categories for comparison including cluster managers,
resource managers, workload managers, and schedulers. There are many existing
tools in each category, and the comparisons are not exhaustive of the entire
space.

### AWS ECS

Amazon Web Services provides the Elastic Container Service (ECS), which is
a cluster manager. The ECS service is only available within AWS and
can only be used for Docker workloads. Amazon provides customers with
the agent that is installed on EC2 instances, but does not provide
the servers which are a hosted service of AWS.

There are a number of fundamental differences between Nomad and ECS.
Nomad is completely open source, including both the client and server
components. By contrast, only the agent code for ECS is open and
the servers are closed sourced and managed by Amazon.

As a side effect of the ECS servers being managed by AWS, it is not possible
to use ECS outside of AWS. Nomad is agnostic to the environment in which it is run,
supporting public and private clouds, as well as bare metal datacenters.
Clusters in Nomad can span multiple datacenters and regions, meaning
a single cluster could be managing machines on AWS, Azure, and GCE simultaneously.

The ECS service is specifically focused on containers and the Docker
engine, while Nomad is more general purpose. Nomad supports virtualized,
containerized, and standalone applications, including Docker. Nomad is
designed with extensible drivers and support will be extended to all
common drivers.

### Terraform

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is a tool for building, changing, and
versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Configuration files describe
to Terraform the components needed to run a single application or your entire
datacenter. Terraform generates an execution plan describing what it will do to
reach the desired state, and then executes it to build the described
infrastructure. As the configuration changes, Terraform is able to determine
what changed and create incremental execution plans which can be applied.

Nomad differs from Terraform in a number of key ways. Terraform is designed to
support any type of resource including low-level components such as compute
instances, storage, and networking, as well as high-level components such as DNS
entries, SaaS features, etc. Terraform knows how to create, provision, and
manage the lifecycle of these resources. Nomad runs on existing infrastructure
and manages the lifecycle of applications running on that infrastructure.

Another major distinction is that Terraform is an offline tool that runs to
completion, while Nomad is an online system with long lived servers. Nomad
allows new jobs to be submitted, existing jobs updated or deleted, and can
handle node failures. This requires operating continuously instead of in a
single shot like Terraform.

For small infrastructures with only a handful of servers or applications, the
complexity of Nomad may not outweigh simply using Terraform to statically assign
applications to machines. At larger scales, Terraform should be used to
provision capacity for Nomad, and Nomad used to manage scheduling applications
to machines dynamically.
