# Command: volume detach

The `volume detach` command detachs external storage volumes with Nomad's
[Container Storage Interface (CSI)][csi] support. The volume must exist on the
remote storage provider before it can be detached and used by a task.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad volume detach [options] [volume] [node]
```

The `volume detach` command requires two arguments, specifying the ID of the
volume to be detached and the node to detach it from. Detaching will fail if
fail if the volume is still in use by an allocation.
