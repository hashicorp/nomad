# Command: license inspect

<EnterpriseAlert>
  This command is only present in Nomad Enterprise.
</EnterpriseAlert>

The `license inspect` command is used to inspect and validate a Nomad Enterprise
license. It will read the license from a file on disk or an environment variable
and exit non-0 if the license is not valid with the Nomad binary.

This command should always be run with the new binary before upgrading Nomad on a server,
as the server agent will not start with an invalid license.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad license inspect [/path/to/license.hclic]
```

```shell-session
$ nomad license inspect /path/to/nomad/license.hclic
