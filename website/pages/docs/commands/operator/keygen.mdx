# Command: operator keygen

The `operator keygen` command generates an encryption key that can be used for
Nomad server's gossip traffic encryption. The keygen command uses a
cryptographically strong pseudo-random number generator to generate the key.

The resulting key is encoded in the [RFC4648] "URL and filename safe" base64
alphabet. If you use another tool such as OpenSSL to generate the gossip key,
you should pipe the input through the `base64(1)` command to ensure it is
safely encoded. For example: `openssl rand 16 | base64`

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad operator keygen
```

## Example

```shell-session
$ nomad operator keygen

```
