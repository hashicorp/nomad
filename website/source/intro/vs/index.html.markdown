# Nomad vs. Other Software

Nomad is a cluster manager and scheduler. There are many related categories
including cluster managers, resource managers, workload managers, and schedulers.
There are many existing tools in each category, and the comparisons are not exhaustive
of the entire space.

Due to the bias of the comparisons being on the Nomad website, we attempt
to only use facts. If you find something that is invalid or out of date
in the comparisons, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues) and we'll
address it as soon as possible.

Use the navigation on the left to read comparisons of Nomad versus other
systems.
