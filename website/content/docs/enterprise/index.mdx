# Nomad Enterprise

This page provides an overview of Nomad Enterprise features that
add operations, collaboration, and governance capabilities such as resource
quotas, Sentinel policies, audit logging, multi-region deployments, and advanced
server management using Nomad Autopilot.

Nomad Enterprise is available as a base platform package with the following
add-on modules:

- Governance and policy
- Multi-cluster and efficiency features

For pricing details or to request a demo, visit [the HashiCorp Enterprise
pricing page for Nomad](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/nomad/pricing).

## Releases

Nomad Enterprise initiated the Long-Term Support (LTS) release program with
Nomad 1.8. Going forward, the first major release of each calendar year is
an LTS release.

LTS releases have the following benefits:

- **Extended maintenance:** Two years of critical fixes provided through minor
releases
- **Efficient upgrades:** Support for direct upgrades from one LTS release
to the next, reducing major-version upgrade risk and improving operational
efficiency.

LTS releases reduce operational overhead and risk by letting organizations
receive critical fixes in minor releases without having to upgrade their major
version more than once a year. Once you have upgraded to Nomad Enterprise 1.8,
you will be running on a maintained LTS release that will allow you to easily
upgrade to the next LTS major release when it's available. For more
information, refer to HashiCorp's multi-product LTS statement.

~> **Note:** A Nomad Enterprise cluster cannot be downgraded to the open
source version of Nomad. Servers running the open source version of Nomad
panic if they are joined to a Nomad Enterprise cluster, due to Raft entries
relating to Enterprise features not being parseable by open source Nomad.


## Platform Features

The Enterprise platform provides advanced Autopilot and scheduling features.

### Advanced Autopilot features
   - **Automated Upgrades**: Simplifies upgrading Nomad clusters with minimal disruption.[](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/enterprise)
   - **Enhanced Read Scalability**: Introduces non-voting server nodes to scale
     read operations and scheduling without impacting write
     latency.[](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/enterprise)
   - **Redundancy Zones**: Deploys non-voting servers as hot standbys per
     availability zone to enhance availability (e.g., one voter and one
     non-voter per zone in a multi-zone
     setup).[](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/enterprise)
2. **Snapshot Backup and Restore**: Provides atomic, point-in-time snapshots for
   automated backup and restoration of Nomad server states, aiding disaster
   recovery.[](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/enterprise)[](https://newreleases.io/project/github/hashicorp/nomad/release/v0.12.0)

### Automated upgrades

With automated upgrades, you may deploy a complete cluster of new
servers with minimal disruption. As the new servers
join the cluster, server logic checks the version of each Nomad server
node. If the version is higher than the version on the current set of voters,
it will avoid promoting the new servers to voters until the number of new
servers matches the number of existing servers at the previous version. Once
the numbers match, Nomad will begin to promote new servers and demote old
ones.

Refer to the [Autopilot upgrade
migrations](/nomad/docs/manage/autopilot#upgrade-migrations) documentation for
details.

### Enhanced read scalability

This feature let you introduce non-voting server nodes to a Nomad
cluster. Non-voting servers receive the replication stream but do not
take part in quorum, which is required by the leader before log entries can be
committed. Adding explicit non-voters scales reads and scheduling without
impacting write latency.

Refer to the [Autopilot server read and scheduling
scaling](/nomad/docs/manage/autopilot#server-read-and-scheduling-scaling)
documentation for details.

### Redundancy zones

Redundancy zones let you deploy a non-voting server as a hot standby server on a
per availability zone basis. For example, in an environment with three
availability zones an operator can run one voter and one non-voter in each
availability zone, for a total of six servers. If an availability zone is
completely lost, only one voter will be lost, so the cluster remains available.
If a voter is lost in an availability zone, Nomad will promote the non-voter to
a voter automatically, putting the hot standby server into service quickly.

Refer to the [Autopilot redundancy
zones](/nomad/docs/manage/autopilot#redundancy-zones) documentation for details.

### Automated snapshot backup and restore

Automated Backups let you run the snapshot agent as a long-running
daemon process or in a one-shot mode from a batch job. The agent takes
snapshots of the state of the Nomad servers and saves them locally, or pushes
them to an optional remote storage service, such as Amazon S3.

This capability provides an enterprise solution for backup and restoring the
state of Nomad servers within an environment in an automated manner. These
snapshots are atomic and point-in-time.

Refer to the [`nomad operator snapshot agent` command
reference](/nomad/commands/operator/snapshot/agent) documentation for details.

### Time-based task execution

Using a CRON-like syntax, you may schedule when tasks should execute and when they should stop. This provides governance for tasks executed from jobs, and allows operators to easily opt-in or opt-out of a schedule that governs when the task can run through the web based UI or through the CLI.

























## Multiple Vault Namespaces

Multi-Vault Namespaces enables an operator to configure a single Nomad cluster
to support multiple Vault Namespaces for topology simplicity and fleet
consolidation when running Nomad and Vault together. Nomad will automatically
retrieve a Vault token based on a job's defined Vault Namespace and make it
available for the specified Nomad task at hand.

Refer to the [Vault Integration documentation](/nomad/docs/secure/vault/acl#vault-namespaces)) for more information.

## Multiple Vault and Consul Clusters

Nomad Enteprise allows sepcifying multiple integrations for Consul and Vault in
the [vault](/nomad/docs/configuration/vault) and
[consul](/nomad/docs/configuration/consul) portions of the Nomad agent
configuration. After the agents are configured, Nomad jobspec writers can pick
which Consul or Vault cluster to use in their job. Nomad administrators may
also set default clusters for each in Nomad namespace configuration, as well as
deny access to certain clusters by namespace.

## NUMA Awareness for Device Resources

Nomad is able to correlate CPU cores with memory nodes and assign tasks to run  on specific CPU cores so as to minimize any cross-memory node access patterns.  With Nomad 1.9, we are expanding this functionality to also correlate devices  to memory nodes and enable NUMA-aware scheduling to take device associativity  into account when making scheduling decisions.

## Governance & Policy

Governance & Policy features are part of an add-on module that enables an
organization to securely operate Nomad at scale across multiple teams through
features such as Audit Logging, Resource Quotas, and Sentinel Policies.

### Audit Logging

Secure clusters with enhanced risk management and operational traceability to
fulfill compliance requirements. This Enterprise feature provides
administrators with a complete set of records for all user-issued actions in
Nomad.

With Audit Logging, enterprises can now proactively identify access anomalies,
ensure enforcement of their security policies, and diagnose cluster behavior
by viewing preceding user operations. Designed as an HTTP API based audit
logging system, each audit event is captured with relevant request and
response information in a JSON format that is easily digestible and familiar
to operators.

See the [Audit Logging Documentation](/nomad/docs/configuration/audit) for a
thorough overview.

### Resource Quotas

Resource Quotas enable an operator to limit resource consumption across teams
or projects to reduce waste and align budgets. In Nomad Enterprise, operators
can define [quota specifications](/nomad/docs/other-specifications/quota)
and apply them to namespaces. When a quota is attached to a namespace,
the jobs within the namespace may not consume more resources than the quota
specification allows.

This allows operators to partition a shared cluster and ensure that no single
actor can consume the whole resources of the cluster.

See the [Resource Quotas
Guide](/nomad/docs/govern/resource-quotas) for a thorough
overview.

### Sentinel Policies

In Nomad Enterprise, operators can create Sentinel policies for fine-grained
policy enforcement. Sentinel policies build on top of the ACL system and allow
operators to define policies such as disallowing jobs to be submitted to
production on Fridays or only allowing users to run jobs that use
pre-authorized Docker images. Sentinel policies are defined as code, giving
operators considerable flexibility to meet compliance requirements.

See the [Sentinel Policies Guide][] for a walk-through on deploying Sentinel
policies and the [Nomad Sentinel policy reference][] for more information on
what objects are available for policies.

## Multi-Cluster & Efficiency

Multi-Cluster & Efficiency features are part of an add-on module that enables
an organization to operate Nomad at scale across multiple clusters through
features such as Multiregion Deployments.

### Multiregion Deployments

[Multiregion Deployments] enable an operator to deploy a single job to multiple
federated regions. This includes the ability to control the order of rollouts
and how each region will behave in the event of a deployment failure.

### Dynamic Application Sizing

Dynamic Application Sizing enables organizations to optimize the resource
consumption of applications using sizing recommendations from Nomad. This
feature builds on Nomad [autoscaling capabilities] to remove the trial-and-error
routine of manually setting resource requirements. DAS comprises support for
vertical [scaling policies], a new API and UI for reviewing recommended job
changes, and a collection of Nomad Autoscaler plugins informed by best-practice
statistical measures.
