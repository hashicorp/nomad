# `nomad operator snapshot restore` command reference

The `operator snapshot restore` command restores an atomic, point-in-time
snapshot of the state of the Nomad servers, which includes jobs, nodes,
allocations, periodic jobs, and ACLs.

Restoration involves a potentially dangerous low-level Raft operation that is
not designed to handle server failures during a restore. This command is
primarily intended for recovering from a disaster, restoring into a
fresh cluster of Nomad servers.

If you enabled ACLs, you must supply a management token in order to perform
snapshot operations.

This example srestore a snapshot from the file `backup.snap`.

```shell-session
$ nomad operator snapshot restore backup.snap
```

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad operator snapshot restore [options] <file>
```

## General options

@include 'general_options_no_namespace.mdx'
