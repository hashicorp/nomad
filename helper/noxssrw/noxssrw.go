// Changing the header map after a call to WriteHeader (or

// trailers.
//
// There are two ways to set Trailers. The preferred way is to
// predeclare in the headers which trailers you will later
// send by setting the "Trailer" header to the names of the
// trailer keys which will come later. In this case, those
// keys of the Header map are treated as if they were
// trailers. See the example. The second way, for trailer
// keys not known to the Handler until after the first Write,
// is to prefix the Header map keys with the TrailerPrefix
// constant value. See TrailerPrefix.
//
// To suppress automatic response headers (such as "Date"), set
// their value to nil.

// Write writes the data to the connection as part of an HTTP reply.
//
// If WriteHeader has not yet been called, Write calls
// WriteHeader(http.StatusOK) before writing the data. If the Header
// does not contain a Content-Type line, Write adds a Content-Type set
// to the result of passing the initial 512 bytes of written data to
// DetectContentType. Additionally, if the total size of all written
// data is under a few KB and there are no Flush calls, the
// Content-Length header is added automatically.
//
// Depending on the HTTP protocol version and the client, calling
// Write or WriteHeader may prevent future reads on the
// Request.Body. For HTTP/1.x requests, handlers should read any
// needed request body data before writing the response. Once the
// headers have been flushed (due to either an explicit Flusher.Flush
// call or writing enough data to trigger a flush), the request body
// may be unavailable. For HTTP/2 requests, the Go HTTP server permits
// handlers to continue to read the request body while concurrently
// writing the response. However, such behavior may not be supported
// by all HTTP/2 clients. Handlers should read before writing if
// possible to maximize compatibility.
