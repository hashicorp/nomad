## 0.3.1 (UNRELEASED)

IMPROVEMENTS:
  * cli: Validate job file schemas [GH-900]
  * client: Add environment variables for task name, allocation ID/Name/Index
    [GH-869, GH-896]
  * client: Starting task is retried under the restart policy if the error is

## 0.3.0

__BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:__
  * Stdout and Stderr log files of tasks have moved from task/local to
    alloc/logs [GH-851]
  * Any users of the runtime environment variable `$NOMAD_PORT_` will need to
    update to the new `${NOMAD_ADDR_}` varriable [GH-704]
  * Service names that include periods will fail validation. To fix, remove any
    periods from the service name before running the job [GH-770]
  * Task resources are now validated and enforce minimum resources. If a job
    specifies resources below the minimum they will need to be updated [GH-739]
  * Node ID is no longer specifiable. For users who have set a custom Node
    ID, the node should be drained before Nomad is updated and the data_dir
    should be deleted before starting for the first time [GH-675]
  * Users of custom restart policies should update to the new syntax which adds
    a `mode` field. The `mode` can be either `fail` or `delay`. The default for
    `batch` and `service` jobs is `fail` and `delay` respectively [GH-594]
  * All jobs that interpret variables in constraints or driver configurations
    will need to be updated to the new syntax which wraps the interpreted
    variable in curly braces. (`$node.class` becomes `${node.class}`) [GH-760]
