# Command: job promote

The `job promote` command is used to promote task groups in the most recent
deployment for the given job. Promotion should occur when the deployment has
placed canaries for a task group and those canaries have been deemed healthy.
When a task group is promoted, the rolling upgrade of the remaining allocations
is unblocked. If the canaries are found to be unhealthy, the deployment may
either be failed using the "nomad deployment fail" command, the job can be
failed forward by submitting a new version or failed backwards by reverting to
an older version using the [job revert] command.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad job promote [options] <job>
```

The `job promote` command requires a single argument, a job ID or
prefix. When run without specifying any groups to promote, the promote command
promotes all task groups. The group flag can be specified multiple times to
select particular groups to promote.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the `submit-job`,
`list-jobs`, and `read-job` capabilities for the job's namespace.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Promote Options

- `-group`: Group may be specified many times and is used to promote that
  particular group. If no specific groups are specified, all groups are
  promoted.

- `-detach`: Return immediately instead of monitoring. A new evaluation ID
  will be output, which can be used to examine the evaluation using the
  [eval status] command.

- `-verbose`: Show full information.

## Examples

Promote canaries in all groups:

```shell-session
# Have two task groups waiting for promotion.
