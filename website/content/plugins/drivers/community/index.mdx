# Community task driver plugins

Task driver plugins authored and maintained by the Nomad community are listed on
the [Nomad integrations page](/nomad/integrations). On that page, select
**Community** from the **Tiers** list and **Task Drivers** from the **Types**
list to review Community-authored task driver plugins.

If you have authored a task driver plugin that you believe is useful to the
broader Nomad community and are committed to maintaining the plugin,
create a [Nomad GitHub issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues) so we can add your plugin to the Nomad Integrations page.

For details on authoring a task driver plugin, refer to the [plugin
authoring guide](/nomad/docs/concepts/plugins).
