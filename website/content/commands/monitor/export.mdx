# `nomad monitor export` command reference

The `nomad monitor export` command returns logs written to disk or journald by a nomad agent.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad monitor export [options]
```

Use the `nomad monitor export` command to export an agent's historic data
from journald or its Nomad log file. If exporting journald logs, you must
pass `-service-name` with the name of the systemd unit to query.
The `-logs-since` and `-follow` options are only valid for journald queries.
You may pass a duration string to the `-logs-since` option to override the
default 72h duration. Nomad will accept the following time units in the
`-logs-since` duration string: "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
The `-follow=true` option causes the agent to continue to stream logs until
interrupted or until the remote agent quits. Nomad only supports journald
queries on Linux.

If you do not use Linux or you do not run Nomad as a systemd unit, pass the
`-on-disk=true` option to export the entirety of a given agent's nomad log file.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the `agent:read`
capability.

## Options

- `-node-id`: Specifies the client node-id to stream logs from. If no
  node-id is given, the Nomad server from the `-address` flag is used.

- `-server-id`: Specifies the Nomad server id to stream logs from. Accepts
  server names from `nomad server members` and also a special `leader` option
  which will target the current leader.

- `-service-name`: Specifies the the name of the systemd unit for export.
  Do not use with `-on-disk`. Must include 'nomad' and conform to systemd
  naming conventions. You may provide the full systemd file name
  or omit the suffix. If your service name includes a '.', you must include
  a valid suffix (e.g. nomad.client.service).
  
- `-logs-since`: Duration used to determine how far back to return logs from
  journald. Ignored if used with `-on-disk` and defaults to `72h` if  not set.

- `-follow`: Boolean that, if true, continues streaming journald logs until
  interrupted. Do not use with `-on-disk`
  
- `-on-disk`: Boolean that, if true, returns the contents of the Nomad log file
  defined in the agent config.

## Examples

This example returns journald log entries with a specific node ID and service name.

```shell-session
$ nomad monitor export -node-id=$(nomad node status --quiet) -service-name="nomad"
Jun 04 20:09:29 nomad-client01 systemd[1]: Starting Nomad...
Subject: A start job for unit nomad_client.service has begun execution
```

This example returns the contents of the nomad log file for a specific server.

```shell-session
$ nomad monitor export -server-id=a57b2adb-1a30-2dda-8df0-25abb0881952 -on-disk=true
2025-06-20T12:22:08.528-0500 [DEBUG] http: request complete: method=GET path=/v1/agent/health?type=server duration=1.445739ms
2025-06-20T12:22:09.892-0500 [DEBUG] nomad: memberlist: Stream connection from=127.0.0.1:53628
