# Federated cluster operations

This page lists operational considerations for running multi-region federated
clusters as well as instructions for migrating the authoritative region to a
federated region.

## Operational considerations

When operating multi-region federated Nomad clusters, consider the following:

* **Regular snapshots**: You can back up Nomad server state using the
  [`nomad operator snapshot save`][] and [`nomad operator snapshot agent`][] commands. Performing
  regular backups expedites disaster recovery. The cadence depends on cluster rates of change
  and your internal SLAâ€™s. You should regularly test snapshots using the
  [`nomad operator snapshot restore`][] command to ensure they work.

* **Local ACL management tokens**: You need local management tokens to perform federated cluster
  administration when the authoritative region is down. Make sure you have existing break-glass
  tokens available for each region.

* **Known paths to creating local ACL tokens**: If the authoritative region fails, creation of
  global ACL tokens fails. If this happens, having the ability to create local ACL tokens allows
  you to continue to interact with each available federated region.

## Authoritative and federated regions

* **Can non-authoritative regions continue to operate if the authoritative region is unreachable?**:
  Yes, running workloads are never interrupted due to federation failures. Scheduling of new
  workloads and rescheduling of failed workloads is never interrupted due to federation failures.
  See [Failure Scenarios][failure_scenarios] for details.

* **Can the authoritative region be deployed with servers only?** Yes, deploying the Nomad
  authoritative region with servers only, without clients, works as expected. This servers-only
  approach can expedite disaster recovery of the region. Restoration does not include objects such
  as nodes, jobs, or allocations, which are large and require compute intensive reconciliation
  after restoration.

* **Can I migrate the authoritative region to a currently federated region?** It is possible by
  following these steps:

  1. Update the [`authoritative_region`][] configuration parameter on the desired authoritative
    region servers.
  1. Restart the server processes in the new authoritative region and ensure all data is present in
    state as expected. If the network was partitioned as part of the failure of the original
    authoritative region, writes of replicated objects may not have been successfully replicated to
    federated regions.
  1. Update the [`authoritative_region`][] configuration parameter on the federated region servers
    and restart their processes.

* **Can federated regions be bootstrapped while the authoritative region is down?**  No they
cannot.
