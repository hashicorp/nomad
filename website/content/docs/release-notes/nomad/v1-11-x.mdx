# Nomad 1.11.x release notes

We are pleased to announce the following Nomad updates.

## 1.11.0 release highlights

### Client node introduction and identity

Nomad's client node identity feature uniquely identities each Nomad client node
and provides an authentication mechanism for nodes to make RPC calls to the
Nomad servers.

Introduce Nomad clients to the cluster with JWT tokens. Configure Nomad servers
with introduction enforcement levels that dictate how clients join the cluster.
This approach results in logs and metrics to detail introduction violations.
Once registered, Nomad clients are now provided with an identity token, used for
RPC communication which is periodically renewed.

#### Relevant documentation

- [Client node identity concepts](/nomad/docs/architecture/cluster/node-identity)
- [Client identity node pool TTL configuration option](/nomad/docs/other-specifications/node-pool#node_identity_ttl)
- [Client Introduction server configuration options](/nomad/docs/configuration/server#client_introduction-parameters)
- [Client introduction monitoring detail](/nomad/docs/monitor#client-introduction)
- [Client introduction agent CLI token flag](/nomad/commands/agent#client-intro-token)

Commands:

- [`nomad node intro create`](/nomad/commands/node/intro/create): Generates a node introduction token which is a signed JWT.
- [`nomad node identity get`](/nomad/commands/node/identity/get): View the identity claims for a node.
- [`nomad node identity renew`](/nomad/commands/node/identity/renew):  Instruct a node to renew its identity of its next heartbeat.
- [`nomad node pool info`](/nomad/commands/node-pool/info): View the identity TTL for nodes in the provided pool.
- [`nomad operator client-state`](/nomad/commands/operator/client-state): View
  the client persistent state in JSON, which includes the client identity.
- [`nomad agent` command's `-client-intro-token` parameter](/nomad/commands/agent#client-intro-token): Set the JWT token used  to authenticate with servers during the client's initial registration.

API:

- [`/v1/acl/identity/client-introduction-token`](/nomad/api-docs/acl/identities#create-client-introduction-identity): Generates a node introduction token which is a signed JWT.
- [`/v1/client/identity`](/nomad/api-docs/client#read-a-node-s-identity-claims): View the identity claims for a node.
- [`/v1/client/identity/renew`](/nomad/api-docs/client#renew-a-node-s-identity): Instruct a node to renew its identity of its next heartbeat.
- [`/v1/node/pool/:node_pool`](/nomad/api-docs/node-pools#read-node-pool): View the identity TTL for nodes in the provided pool.

### Artifact secrets

Use the new job specification secrets block to fetch and interpolate secrets
from a specified location. Nomad automatically retrieves the contents of the
secret. In your task specification, reference the variable with
`${secret.secret_name.key}` format.

Nomad provides built-in support to fetch secrets from Nomad and
Vault. Alternately, you may build your own custom secret provider.

#### Relevant documentation

- [Job specification `secret` block](/nomad/docs/job-specification/secret)
- [Secret provider plugin authoring guide](/nomad/plugins/author/secret-provider)


### System job deployments

Jobs of type “system” now support deployment functionality, so you may roll out
job updates in a more controlled manner. Additionally, you may now view system
job deployment status in the web UI.

#### Relevant documentation

- [Job specification `update` block](/nomad/docs/job-specification/update)
- [Blue/Green deployment detail](/nomad/docs/job-declare/strategy/blue-green-canary)
- [`nomad deployment` commands](/nomad/commands/deployment) for interacting with Nomad job deployments

### Scheduler improvements

We improved Nomad's scheduler observability for job authors.

#### Relevant documentation

- [`nomad eval status` command](/nomad/commands/eval/status): View more details
  on an evaluation including related evaluations, successful placements,
  scheduler annotations, failed placements, and preemptions.

   - The **Plan Annotations** table represents the intended plan before Nomad
     checks nodes for feasibility. This can help you narrow down where in the
     scheduling pipeline unexpected results are coming from.
   - The [Nomad repository scheduler
     README](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/blob/v1.11.0/scheduler/README.md)
     has architectural details.
- [`nomad alloc status` command](/nomad/commands/alloc/status): When you run the
  command with the `-verbose` flag, the output includes information about the
  scheduler's placement decision, including the number of nodes evaluated and
  rejected, and the scoring of each node considered.

### Additional census usage metrics <EnterpriseAlert inline/>

We added several Enterprise reporting metrics.

#### Relevant documentation

- [Automated license utilization
  reporting](/nomad/docs/enterprise/license/utilization-reporting)
- Agent reporting configuration [`disable_product_usage_reporting`
  parameter](/nomad/docs/configuration/reporting#disable_product_usage_reporting):
  Disable detailed product usage metrics.
- [`nomad operator utilization` command](/nomad/commands/operator/utilization):
  If you have disabled automated reporting, use this command to manually
  generate the report and send it to HashiCorp.
