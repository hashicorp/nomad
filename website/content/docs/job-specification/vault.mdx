# `vault` Block

<Placement
  groups={[
    ['job', 'vault'],
    ['job', 'group', 'vault'],
    ['job', 'group', 'task', 'vault'],
  ]}
/>

The `vault` block allows a task to specify that it requires a token from a
[HashiCorp Vault][vault] server. Nomad will automatically retrieve a Vault token
for the task and handle token renewal for the task. If specified at the `group`
level, the configuration will apply to all tasks within the group. If specified
at the `job` level, the configuration will apply to all tasks within the job. If
multiple `vault` blocks are specified, they are merged with the `task` block
taking the highest precedence, then the `group`, then the `job`.

```hcl
job "docs" {
  group "example" {
    task "server" {
      vault {
        cluster  = "default"
        role     = "prod"

        change_mode   = "signal"
        change_signal = "SIGUSR1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The Nomad client will make the Vault token available to the task by writing it
to the secret directory at `secrets/vault_token` and by injecting a `VAULT_TOKEN`
environment variable. If the Nomad cluster is [configured](/nomad/docs/configuration/vault#namespace)
to use [Vault Namespaces](/vault/docs/enterprise/namespaces),
a `VAULT_NAMESPACE` environment variable will be injected whenever `VAULT_TOKEN` is set.
This behavior can be altered using the `env` and `file` parameters.

If Nomad is unable to renew the Vault token (perhaps due to a Vault outage or
network error), the client will attempt to retrieve a new Vault token. If successful, the
contents of the secrets file are updated on disk, and action will be taken
according to the value set in the `change_mode` parameter.

If a `vault` block is specified, the [`template`][template] block can interact
with Vault as well.

## `vault` Parameters

- `allow_token_expiration` `(bool: false)` - Specifies that Nomad clients should
  not attempt to renew a task's Vault token, allowing it to expire. This should
  only be used when a secret is requested from Vault once at the start of a task
  or in a short-lived prestart task. Long-running tasks should never set
  `allow_token_expiration=true` if they obtain Vault secrets via `template`
  blocks, as the Vault token will expire and the template runner will continue
  to make failing requests to Vault until its [`vault_retry`][] attempts are
  exhausted, at which point the task will fail.

  When Nomad has been configured to use [Workload Identity with Vault][], Nomad
  clients will automatically detect when tokens cannot be refreshed (for
  example, when the Vault auth method is configured to issue batch tokens). In
  this case, the `allow_token_expiration` option will be implicitly set to
  `true` by the client. The [legacy Vault authentication workflow][] cannot
  automatically detect this.

- `change_mode` `(string: "restart")` - Specifies the behavior Nomad should take
  if the Vault token changes. The possible values are:

  - `"noop"` - take no action (continue running the task)
  - `"restart"` - restart the task
  - `"signal"` - send a configurable signal to the task

- `change_signal` `(string: "")` - Specifies the signal to send to the task as a
  string like `"SIGUSR1"` or `"SIGINT"`. This option is required if the
  `change_mode` is `signal`.

- `cluster` `(string: "default")` <EnterpriseAlert inline/> - Specifies the
  Vault cluster to use. The Nomad client will retrieve a Vault token from the
  cluster configured in the agent configuration with the same
  [`vault.name`][]. In Nomad Community Edition, this field is ignored.

- `env` `(bool: true)` - Specifies if the `VAULT_TOKEN` and `VAULT_NAMESPACE`
  environment variables should be set when starting the task.

- `disable_file` `(bool: false)` - Specifies if the Vault token should be
  written to `secrets/vault_token`.
  <Warning>
    While the <code>secrets</code> path is not shared with tasks that
    use <a href="/nomad/docs/concepts/filesystem#image-isolation">
      <code>image</code>
    </a> filesystem isolation, it is still accessible by tasks using <a href="/nomad/docs/concepts/filesystem#chroot-isolation">
      <code>chroot</code>
    </a> or <a href="/nomad/docs/concepts/filesystem#none-isolation"><code>none</code>
    </a> isolation.
  </Warning>

- `namespace` `(string: "")` <EnterpriseAlert inline/> - Specifies the Vault Namespace
  to use for the task. The Nomad client will retrieve a Vault token that is scoped to
  this particular namespace.

- `policies` `(array<string>: [])` - Specifies the set of Vault policies that
  the task requires. The Nomad client will retrieve a Vault token that is
  limited to those policies. This field may only be used with the legacy Vault
  authentication workflow and not with JWT and workload identity. It is
  deprecated in favor of the `role` field and will be removed in Nomad 1.9.

- `role` `(string: "")` - Specifies the Vault role used when retrieving a token
  from Vault using JWT and workload identity. If not specified the client's
  [`create_from_role`][] value is used.

## `vault` Examples

The following examples only show the `vault` blocks. Remember that the
`vault` block is only valid in the placements listed above.

### Retrieve Token

This example tells the Nomad client to retrieve a Vault token. The token is
available to the task via the canonical environment variable `VAULT_TOKEN` and
written to disk at `secrets/vault_token`. The resulting token will have the
Vault policies from the "prod" role attached.

```hcl
vault {
  role = "prod"
}
```

### Signal Task

This example shows signaling the task instead of restarting it.

```hcl
vault {
  role = "prod"

  change_mode   = "signal"
  change_signal = "SIGINT"
}
```

### Private Token and Change Modes

This example retrieves a Vault token that is not shared with the task when using
a driver that provides `image` isolation like [Docker][docker].

This allows Nomad to use a powerful Vault token that interacts with the task's
[`template`][template] stanzas to issue all kinds of secrets (e.g., database
secrets, other vault tokens, etc.), without sharing that issuing power with
the task itself:

```hcl
vault {
  role        = "prod"
  change_mode = "noop"
  env         = false
  file        = false
}

template {
  data = <<-EOH
{{with secret "auth/token/create/nomad-job" "policies=examplepolicy"}}{{.Auth.ClientToken}}{{ end }}
EOH

  destination = "${NOMAD_SECRETS_DIR}/examplepolicy.token"
  change_mode = "noop"
  perms       = "600"
}

template {
  data = <<-EOH
{{ with secret "pki_int/issue/nomad-task"
   "common_name=example.service.consul" "ttl=72h"
   "alt_names=localhost" "ip_sans=127.0.0.1"}}
{{ .Data.certificate }}
{{ .Data.private_key }}
{{ end }}
EOH

  destination = "${NOMAD_SECRETS_DIR}/client.crt"
  change_mode = "restart"
  perms       = "600"
}
```

The example above uses `change_mode = "noop"` in the `template` stanza for
`examplepolicy.token`, which means that the task's workload is responsible for
detecting and handling changes to that file. In contrast, the `template` stanza
for `client.crt` is configured so that Nomad will restart the task whenever
the certificate is reissued, as indicated by `change_mode = "restart"`
(which is the default value for `change_mode`).


### Vault Namespace

This example shows specifying a particular Vault namespace for a given task.

<EnterpriseAlert />

```hcl
vault {
  role      = "prod"
  namespace = "engineering/frontend"

  change_mode   = "signal"
  change_signal = "SIGINT"
}
