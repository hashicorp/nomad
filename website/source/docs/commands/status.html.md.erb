# Command: status

The `status` command displays status information for jobs.

## Usage

```
nomad status [options] [job]
```

This command accepts an option job ID as the sole argument. If the job ID is
provided, information about the specific job is queried and displayed. If the ID
is omitted, the command lists out all of the existing jobs and a few of the most
useful status fields for each.

## General Options

## Status Options

* `-short`: Display short output. Used only when a single node is being queried.
  Drops verbose node allocation data from the output.
