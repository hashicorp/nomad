# `nomad service list` command reference

The `service list` command is used to list the registered Nomad services.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad service list [options]
```

The `service list` command requires no arguments.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the `read-job`
capability for the namespace being queried.

The command supports the wildcard namespace identifier. Any namespaces that
the token does not have access to will have its services filtered from the
results.

## Options

- `-json`: Output the services in its JSON format.

- `-t`: Format and display the services using a Go template.

## Examples

List all services in the `default` namespace:

```shell-session
$ nomad service list
Service Name         Tags
example-cache-redis  [cache,db]
```

List all services in all namespaces:

```shell-session
$ nomad service list -namespace="*"
Service Name                  Namespace  Tags
example-cache-redis           default    [cache,db]
platform-example-cache-redis  platform   []
```
