# There can only be a single job definition per file. This job is named

# The "job" stanza is the top-most configuration option in the job
# specification. A job is a declarative specification of tasks that Nomad
# should run. Jobs have a globally unique name, one or many task groups, which
# are themselves collections of one or many tasks.
#
# For more information and examples on the "job" stanza, please see
# the online documentation at:
#
#     https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/job.html

  # The "datacenters" parameter specifies the list of datacenters which should
  # be considered when placing this task. This must be provided.
  datacenters = ["dc1"]

  # The "type" parameter controls the type of job, which impacts the scheduler's
  # decision on placement. This configuration is optional and defaults to
  # "service". For a full list of job types and their differences, please see
  # the online documentation.

  # For more information, please see the online documentation at:

  # The "constraint" stanza defines additional constraints for placing this job,

  # For more information and examples on the "constraint" stanza, please see

  # job, it applies to all groups within the job. When placed at both the job and

      # The "resources" stanza describes the requirements a task needs to
