# When using Nomad with Consul it is not necessary to start Consul first. These
# lines start Consul before Nomad as an optimization to avoid Nomad logging
# that Consul is unavailable at startup.
#Wants=consul.service
#After=consul.service

## Configure unit start rate limiting. Units which are started more than
## *burst* times within an *interval* time span are not permitted to start any
## more. Use `StartLimitIntervalSec` or `StartLimitInterval` (depending on
## systemd version) to configure the checking interval and `StartLimitBurst`
## to configure how many starts per interval are allowed. The values in the
## commented lines are defaults.

# StartLimitBurst = 5

## StartLimitIntervalSec is used for systemd versions >= 230
# StartLimitIntervalSec = 10s

## StartLimitInterval is used for systemd versions < 230
# StartLimitInterval = 10s

# Nomad Server agents should never be force killed,

# However, you may wish to change this for Client agents, since
# the workloads that Nomad places may be more important
# than the Nomad agent itself.
