# Run Nomad jobs

This section provides guidance for running Nomad jobs. Inspect job, access logs
for troubleshooting, collect resource utilization metrics, and create job
versions.

Refer to [Create and submit a job](/nomad/docs/job-declare/create-job) to learn
how to create a job specification, review the job plan, and submit the job.

## Run a job

Execute the [`nomad job run` command](/nomad/commands/job/run) to run your job.

Now that the job is scheduled, it may or may not be running. You need to inspect
the allocation status and logs to make sure the job started correctly. Refer to
the section on [inspecting state](/nomad/docs/job-run/inspect)
details ways to examine this job's state.
