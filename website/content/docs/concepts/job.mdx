# Jobs

This page explains the concept of a job, which is the Nomad construct for
deploying your apps, maintenance scripts, cron jobs, and similar tasks. A job is
a workload for Nomad.

## Background

A job is a declarative specification of tasks that Nomad should run. Each job
can have one or more [task groups][task-groups], which are collections of one or more [tasks].

Declare the the desired state of your job in a job specification that describes
the tasks and resources constraints necessary for the job to run. You can
include job constraints, such as which clients Nomad should run the job on.

When you submit your job specification, Nomad creates a job along with
[allocations] for each group defined in the spec. Nomad makes sure the actual
state matches your desired state.

## Job statuses

After you submit your job, Nomad assigns a status to indicate how a job is
performing. This status is based on running, healthy allocations versus desired
job state.

The Nomad UI displays different statuses than what the CLI commands and API
calls return. Whereas the UI displays intuitive statuses, the CLI and API return
rigid statuses that relate to how you might approach scheduling and garbage
collection.

This table maps the CLI and API statuses to what Nomad displays in the UI.

| CLI and API Status | UI Status |
| ---------------    | --------------- |
| `complete `        | `Complete`    |
| `dead`             | `Failed`, `Scaled Down`, `Stopped` |
| `running`          | `Degraded`, `Deploying`, `Healthy`, `Recovering`, `Running`, `Scaled Down` |


### Complete

The `Complete` status indicated that all expected allocations are complete. This
status applies to only batch and sysbatch jobs.

### Degraded

The `Degraded` status indicates that a [deployment] is not taking place. Some allocations are failed, lost, or unplaced.

### Deploying

The `Deploying` status indicates that a deployment is actively taking place.

### Failed

The `Failed` status indicates that all allocations are failed, lost, or unplaced.

### Healthy

The `Healthy` status indicates that all expected allocations are running and healthy.

### Recovering

The `Recovering` status indicates that some allocations are pending.

### Removed

The `Removed` status indicates that the job appeared in the initial query but
has since been garbage collected. This happens when the user remains on the page
for a long time.

### Running

The `Running` status indicates that all expected allocations are running. This
status applies to only batch and sysbatch jobs.

### Scaled Down

The `Scaled Down` status indicates that a user has scaled all allocations to
zero. Nomad has not yet purged or garbage collected the job.

### Stopped

The `Stopped` status indicates that a user has manually stopped the job.
Nomad has not yet purged or garbage collected the job.

## Job resources

Refer to the following Nomad documentation pages for more information about
jobs:

- The [job specification](/nomad/docs/job-specification) containts detailed
  configuration and examples.
- The [Schedulers] page explains the different types of Nomad schedulers and how
  those schedulers run jobs.

These tutorial resources contain examples of different kinds of jobs and how to
configure them:

- The [Quick Start][quickstart] tutorials covers deploying an application and
  its resources, which include parameterized and periodic jobs.
- The [Deploy and Manage Jobs][deploy-jobs] tutorial contains examples of different types of jobs.
- The [Create Nomad Job Specifications][job-spec-tutorial] collection explains several aspects of job creation, including parameterized jobs and deploying a Java app  on Nomad.
