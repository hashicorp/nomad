# Command: volume register

The `volume register` command registers external storage volumes with
Nomad's [Container Storage Interface (CSI)][csi] support. The volume
must exist on the remote storage provider before it can be registered
and used by a task.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad volume register [options] [file]
```

The `volume register` command requires a single argument, specifying
the path to a file containing a valid [volume
specification][volume_specification]. This file will be read and the
job will be submitted to Nomad for scheduling. If the supplied path is
"-", the job file is read from STDIN. Otherwise it is read from the
file at the supplied path.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Volume Specification

The file may be provided as either HCL or JSON. An example HCL configuration:

```hcl
id = "ebs_prod_db1"
name = "database"
type = "csi"
external_id = "vol-23452345"
plugin_id = "ebs-prod"
access_mode = "single-node-writer"
attachment_mode = "file-system"
mount_options {
   fs_type = "ext4"
   mount_flags = ["ro"]
}
```

## Volume Specification Parameters

- `id` `(string: <required>)` - The unique ID of the volume. This will
  be how [`volume`][csi_volume] stanzas in a jobspec refer to the volume.

- `name` `(string: <required>)` - The display name of the volume.

- `type` `(string: <required>)` - The type of volume. Currently only
  `"csi"` is supported.

- `external_id` `(string: <required>)` - The ID of the physical volume
  from the storage provider. For example, the volume ID of an AWS EBS
  volume or Digital Ocean volume.

- `plugin_id` `(string: <required>)` - The ID of the [CSI
  plugin][csi_plugin] that manages this volume.

- `access_mode` `(string: <required>)` - Defines whether a volume
  should be available concurrently. Can be one of
  `"single-node-reader-only"`, `"single-node-writer"`,
  `"multi-node-reader-only"`, `"multi-node-single-writer"`, or
  `"multi-node-multi-writer"`. Most CSI plugins support only
  single-node modes. Consult the documentation of the storage provider
  and CSI plugin.

- `attachment_mode` `(string: <required>)` - The storage API that will
  be used by the volume. Most storage providers will support
  `"file-system"`, to mount pre-formatted file system volumes. Some
  storage providers will support `"block-device"`, which will require
  the job be configured with appropriate mount options.

- `mount_options` <code>([mount_options][]:nil)</code> - Options for
  mounting `block-device`volumes without a pre-formatted file system.
  - `fs_type`: file system type (ex. `"ext4"`)
  - `mount_flags`: the flags passed to `mount` (ex. `"ro,noatime"`)
