# Declare a Nomad job

This section provides guidance for declaring a Nomad job with a job specification.

In Nomad, a job is a user-specified state for a workload. The user expresses the job that should be running, but not where it should run. Nomad allocates resources and ensures that the actual state matches the user's desired state. A job consists of one or more tasks that you can organize into task groups.

Declare the desired state of your job in a [job specification](/nomad/docs/job-specification), or jobspec, that describes the tasks and resources necessary for the job to run. You can also include job constraints to control which clients Nomad runs the job on.

When you submit your job specification, Nomad automatically allocates resources to run it. Nomad also makes sure that the actual job state matches your desired state.

Refer to the [Job page](/nomad/docs/concepts/job) for more information on Nomad jobs.
