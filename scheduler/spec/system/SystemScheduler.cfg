\* TLC Model Configuration for SystemScheduler
\* Includes safety invariants and liveness (SystemCoverage) temporal property

\* ---------- Constants ----------
CONSTANT Nodes = {n1, n2}
CONSTANT Jobs = {j1, j2}

CONSTANT Attrs = [ n1 |-> [zone |-> "us", cores |-> 2],
                   n2 |-> [zone |-> "eu", cores |-> 1] ]

CONSTANT Capacity = [ c1 |-> 2,
                      c2 |-> 1 ]

CONSTANT Demand = [ j1 |-> 1,
                    j2 |-> 1 ]

CONSTANT ConstraintFn = "lambda j, a: a.zone = 'us'"
CONSTANT ScoreFn = "lambda j, a: IF j = j1 THEN a.cores ELSE a.cores - 1"

\* ---------- Notes ----------
\* - SystemCoverage checks that every eligible client eventually receives allocations for all jobs.
\* - Weak fairness ensures the placement action is eventually executed.
\* - Adjust Clients, Jobs, Capacity, Demand, Attrs for larger tests.
