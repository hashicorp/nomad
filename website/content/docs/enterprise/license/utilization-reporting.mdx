# Automated license utilization reporting

Automated license utilization reporting sends license utilization data to HashiCorp without requiring you 
to manually collect and report them. It also lets you review your license usage with the monitoring 
solution you already use (for example Splunk, Datadog, or others) so you can optimize and manage your 
deployments. Use these reports to understand how much more you can deploy under your current contract, 
protect against overutilization, and budget for predicted consumption.  

Automated reporting shares the minimum data required to validate license utilization as defined in our 
contracts. They consist of mostly computed metrics and will never contain Personal Identifiable Information 
(PII) or other sensitive information. Automated reporting shares the data with HashiCorp using a secure, 
unidirectional HTTPS API and makes an auditable record in the product logs each time it submits a report. 
The reporting process is GDPR compliant and submits reports roughly once every 24 hours.

## Enable automated reporting

To enable automated reporting, you need to make sure that outbound network traffic is configured correctly 
and upgrade your enterprise product to a version that supports it. If your installation is air-gapped or 
network settings are not in place, automated reporting will not work. 

### 1. Allow outbound HTTPS traffic on port 443

Make sure that your network allows HTTPS egress on port 443 from https://reporting.hashicorp.services by 
allow-listing the following IP addresses:

- 100.20.70.12
- 35.166.5.222
- 23.95.85.111
- 44.215.244.1

### 2. Upgrade

Upgrade to a release that supports license utilization reporting. These releases include:
- [Nomad v1.7.0](/nomad/downloads) and later

### 3. Check logs

Automatic license utilization reporting will start sending data within roughly 24 hours. Check the product 
logs for records that the data sent successfully.

Instructions on how to check logs. 

```
[DEBUG] core.reporting: beginning snapshot export
[DEBUG] core.reporting: creating payload
[DEBUG] core.reporting: marshalling payload to json
[DEBUG] core.reporting: generating authentication headers
[DEBUG] core.reporting: creating request
[DEBUG] core.reporting: sending request
[DEBUG] core.reporting: performing request: method=POST url=https://reporting.hashicorp.services
[DEBUG] core.reporting: recording audit record
[INFO]  reporting: Report sent: auditRecord={"payload":{"payload_version":"1","license_id":"d2cdd857-4202-5a45-70a6-e4b531050c34","product":"nomad","product_version":"1.6.0","export_timestamp":"2023-05-26T20:09:13.753921087Z","snapshots":[{"snapshot_version":1,"snapshot_id":"0001J724F90F4XWQDSAA76ZQWA","process_id":"01H1CTJPC1S8H7Q45MKTJ689ZW","timestamp":"2023-05-26T20:09:13.753513962Z","schema_version":"1.0.0","service":"nomad","metrics":{"nomad.billable.nodes":{"key":"nomad.billable.nodes","kind":"counter","mode":"write","value":33}}}]}}
[DEBUG] completed recording audit record
[DEBUG] core.reporting: export finished successfully
```

If your installation is air-gapped or your network doesn’t allow the correct egress, logs will show an 
error. 

```
[DEBUG] core.reporting: beginning snapshot export
[DEBUG] core.reporting: creating payload
[DEBUG] core.reporting: marshalling payload to json
[DEBUG] core.reporting: generating authentication headers
[DEBUG] core.reporting: creating request
[DEBUG] core.reporting: sending request
[DEBUG] core.reporting: performing request: method=POST url=https://reporting.hashicorp.services
[DEBUG] core.reporting: error status code received: statusCode=403
```

In this case, reconfigure your network to allow egress and check back in 24 hours. 

## Opt out

If your installation is air-gapped or you want to manually collect and report on the same license 
utilization metrics, you can opt-out of automated reporting. 

Manually reporting these metrics can be time consuming. Opting out of automated reporting does not mean that 
you also opt out from sending license utilization metrics. Customers who opt out of automated reporting will 
still be required to manually collect and send license utilization metrics to HashiCorp. 

If you are considering opting out because you’re worried about the data, we strongly recommend that you 
review the [example payloads](#example-payloads) before opting out. If you have concerns with any of the 
automatically-reported data please bring them to your account manager. 

You have two options to opt out of automated reporting: HCL configuration (recommended) and Environment 
variable (requires restart).

Opting out in your product’s configuration file doesn’t require a system restart, and is the method we 
recommend. Add the following block to your `server.hcl` file.

```hcl
reporting {
	license {
		enabled = false
    }
}
```

If you need to, you can also opt out using an environment variable, which will provide a startup message 
confirming that you have disabled automated reporting. This option requires a system restart. 

Set the following environment variable.

```
$ export OPTOUT_LICENSE_REPORTING=true
```

Now restart your system by following [these instructions](/nomad/docs/operations/nomad-agent). 

Check your product logs roughly 24 hours after opting out to make sure that the system isn’t trying to send 
reports.

If your configuration file and environment variable differ, the environment variable setting will take 
precedence.

## Example payloads

HashiCorp collects the following utilization data as JSON payloads:

`billable.nodes` - Number of billable nodes in Nomad

```json
"metrics": {
    "nomad.billable.nodes": {
        "key": "nomad.billable.nodes",
        "kind": "counter",
        "mode": "write",
        "value": 33
    }
}
```
