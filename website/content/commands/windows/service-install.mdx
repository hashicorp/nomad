# `nomad windows service install` command reference

The `windows service install` command installs the Nomad binary and
creates a Windows service.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad windows service install
```

The `windows service install` command installs the `nomad` binary used to
run this command, creates a data and configuration directory, writes a basic
Nomad configuration file, creates a Windows service to run Nomad, and
registers the service with Windows Event Log.

If Nomad has been previously installed using this command, subsequent
executions will do the following:

1. Stop the service if it is running
1. Install the currently executing nomad binary
1. Ensure data and configuration directories exist
1. Write a configuration file if no configuration files are found
1. Update the service if needed
1. Update the Event Log configuration if needed.

## Options

- `-config-dir <dir>`: Directory to hold the Nomad agent configuration.
  Defaults to "{{.ProgramFiles}}\HashiCorp\nomad\bin"

- `-data-dir <dir>`: Directory to hold the Nomad agent state. Defaults
  to "{{.ProgramData}}\HashiCorp\nomad\data"

- `-install-dir <dir>`: Directory to install the Nomad binary. Defaults 
  to "{{.ProgramData}}\HashiCorp\nomad\config"

- `-reinstall`: Allow the nomad Windows service to be stopped during install.
