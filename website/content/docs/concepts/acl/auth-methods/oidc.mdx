# OpenID Connect (OIDC) Auth Method

Use the `oidc` auth method to authenticate to Nomad with
[OIDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect). This method allows
authentication via a configured OIDC provider using the user's web browser.
Initiate this method from the Nomad UI or the command line.

## Prerequisites

- General knowledge of [OIDC concepts](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/07/25/oidc-primer-part-1)
- [Nomad Access Control List fundamentals][ACL Overview].

Refer to [auth-method create] for the parameters required to create an OIDC auth-method.

## JWT Verification

Nomad uses OIDC discovery to verify JWT signatures against public
keys from the issuer. Nomad first fetches keys from the OIDC
Discovery URL during authentication and then applies OIDC
validation criteria such as `iss` and `aud`.

## OIDC Authentication

Nomad includes two built-in OIDC login flows: the Nomad UI, and the CLI using
[`nomad login`](/nomad/docs/commands/login).

### Redirect URIs

Properly setting redirect URIs is an important part of OIDC auth method
configuration. You must configure this in both Nomad and the OIDC
provider, and these configurations must align. 

Specify the redirect URIs for an auth method with the
`AllowedRedirectURIs` parameter. The Nomad UI and CLI use different
redirect URIs, so you need to configure one or both, depending on your
installation.

#### Nomad UI

Logging in with the Nomad UI requires a redirect URI in one of the following forms:

- `http://localhost:4649/ui/oidc/callback`
- `https://{host:port}/ui/oidc/callback`

The "host:port" must be correct for the Nomad agent serving the Nomad UI.

#### CLI

If you plan to support authentication that uses the
`nomad login -method=<name>` command, you must configure a 
localhost redirect URI, which is usually
`http://localhost:4649/oidc/callback`. Logins that use the CLI may
specify a different host and listening port if needed. A URI with
this host and port must match one of the configured redirected
URIs. You must add these same "localhost" URIs to the provider
as well.

### OIDC Login

#### Nomad UI

1. Select one of the provider links in the Nomad homepage or navigate directly to `/ui/settings/tokens`.
1. Click one of the buttons for your OIDC auth method of choice.
1. Complete the authentication with the configured provider.

#### CLI

Execute the `nomad login -method=oidc` command to log in.

```shell-session
$ nomad login -method=oidc

Complete the login via your OIDC provider. Launching browser to:

    https://myco.auth0.com/authorize?redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A4649%2Foidc%2Fcallback&client_id=r3qXc2bix9eF...
```

Your browser opens to the generated URL to complete the provider's login.
Enter the URL manually if the browser does not automatically open.

The callback listener defaults to `localhost:4649`. You may optionally
pass a host and port to the callback listener with the
`-oidc-callback-addr=<host:port>` flag. In this example, you specify custom host and port.

```shell-session
$ nomad login -method=oidc -oidc-callback-addr=https://custom.host:9080

## OIDC Configuration Troubleshooting

The amount of configuration required for OIDC is relatively small, but it can
be tricky to debug why things aren't working. The following are tips for setting up OIDC:

- Monitor the log output for the Nomad servers for important
information about OIDC validation failures.

- Ensure correct redirect URIs in Nmad and on the provider. URIs
need to match exactly. Check http/https, 127.0.0.1/localhost,
port numbers, and whether trailing slashes are present.

- The `BoundAudiences` option is typically
  not required. OIDC providers use the `client_id` as the audience and
  OIDC validation expects this.

- Check your provider for scopes that are required to receive all of
  the information you need. You often need to request the scopes
  `profile` and `groups`, which you may set with
  `OIDCScopes=["profile", "groups"]` in the auth method configuration.

- If you're seeing claim-related errors in logs, review the provider's docs
  very carefully to see how they're naming and structuring their claims.
  Depending on the provider, you may be able to construct a simple `curl`
  [implicit grant](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/05/24/what-is-the-oauth2-implicit-grant-type)
  request to obtain a JWT that you can inspect. This example decodes the
  JWT located in the `access_token` field of a JSON response.

      jq --raw-output '.access_token / "." | .[1] | @base64d' jwt.json

- With debug level logging, use the `VerboseLogging` option to log the
  received OIDC token. This can be helpful when debugging provider setup
  and verifying that the received claims are what you expect. Since claims
  data is logged verbatim and may contain sensitive information, 
  do not use this option in production.
