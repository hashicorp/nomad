# `csi_plugin` Stanza

<Placement groups={['job', 'group', 'task', 'volume']} />

The "csi_plugin" stanza allows the task to specify it provides a
Container Storage Interface plugin to the cluster. Nomad will
automatically register the plugin so that it can be used by other jobs
to claim [volumes][csi_volumes].

```hcl
csi_plugin {
  id        = "csi-hostpath"
  type      = "monolith"
  mount_dir = "/csi"
}
```

## `csi_plugin` Parameters

- `id` `(string: <required>)` - This is the ID for the plugin. Some
  plugins will require both controller and node plugin types (see
  below); you need to use the same ID for both so that Nomad knows they
  belong to the same plugin.

- `type` `(string: <required>)` - One of `node`, `controller`, or
  `monolith`. Each plugin supports one or more types. Each Nomad
  client node where you want to mount a volume will need a `node`
  plugin instance. Some plugins will also require one or more
  `controller` plugin instances to communicate with the storage
  provider's APIs. Some plugins can serve as both `controller` and
  `node` at the same time, and these are called `monolith`
  plugins. Refer to your CSI plugin's documentation.

- `mount_dir` `(string: <required>)` - The directory path inside the
  container where the plugin will expect a Unix domain socket for
  bidirectional communication with Nomad.

~> **Note:** Plugins running as `node` or `monolith` require root
privileges (or `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` on Linux) to mount volumes on the
host. With the Docker task driver, you can use the `privileged = true`
configuration, but no other default task drivers currently have this
option.

## Recommendations for Deploying CSI Plugins

CSI plugins run as Nomad jobs but after mounting the volume are not in the
data path for the volume. Jobs that mount volumes write and read directly to
the volume via a bind-mount and there is no communication between the job and
the CSI plugin. But when an allocation that mounts a volume stops, Nomad will
need to communicate with the plugin on that allocation's node to unmount the
volume. This has implications on how to deploy CSI plugins:

* During node drains, jobs that claim volumes must be moved before the `node`
  or `monolith` plugin for those volumes. You should run `node` or `monolith`
  plugins as [`system`][system] jobs and use the `-ignore-system` flag on
  `nomad node drain` to ensure that the plugins are running while the node is
  being drained.

* Only one plugin instance of a given plugin ID and type (controller or node)
  should be deployed on any given client node. Use a constraint as shown
  below.

* Some plugins will create volumes only in the same location as the
  plugin. For example, the AWS EBS plugin will create and mount volumes only
  within the same Availability Zone. You should deploy these plugins with a
  unique-per-AZ `plugin_id` to allow Nomad to place allocations in the correct
  AZ.

## `csi_plugin` Examples

```hcl
job "plugin-efs" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]

  # you can run node plugins as service jobs as well, but running
  # as a system job ensures all nodes in the DC have a copy.
  type = "system"

  # only one plugin of a given type and ID should be deployed on
  # any given client node
  constraint {
    operator = "distinct_hosts"
    value = true
  }

  group "nodes" {
    task "plugin" {
      driver = "docker"

      config {
        image = "amazon/aws-efs-csi-driver:latest"

        args = [
          "node",
          "--endpoint=unix://csi/csi.sock",
          "--logtostderr",
          "--v=5",
        ]

        # all CSI node plugins will need to run as privileged tasks
        # so they can mount volumes to the host. controller plugins
        # do not need to be privileged.
        privileged = true
      }

      csi_plugin {
        id        = "aws-efs0"
        type      = "node"
        mount_dir = "/csi"  # this path /csi matches the --endpoint
                            # argument for the container
      }
    }
  }
}
```
