# Containerd Task Driver

Name: `containerd-driver`

Homepage: https://github.com/Roblox/nomad-driver-containerd

Containerd ([`containerd.io`](https://containerd.io)) is a lightweight container daemon
for running and managing container lifecycle. Docker daemon also uses containerd.

```hcl
dockerd (docker daemon) --> containerd --> containerd-shim --> runc
```

`nomad-driver-containerd` enables Nomad clients to launch containers directly using containerd, without Docker!
The Docker daemon is therefore not required on the host system.

See the project's [`homepage`](https://github.com/Roblox/nomad-driver-containerd) for more details.

## Client Requirements

The containerd task driver is not built into Nomad. It must be [`downloaded`](https://github.com/Roblox/nomad-driver-containerd/releases/)
onto the client host in the configured plugin directory.

- Linux (Ubuntu >=16.04) with [`containerd`](https://containerd.io/downloads/) (>=1.3) installed.
- [`containerd-driver`](https://github.com/Roblox/nomad-driver-containerd/releases/) binary in Nomad's [plugin_dir][plugin_dir].

## Capabilities

The `containerd-driver` implements the following [capabilities](/docs/internals/plugins/task-drivers#capabilities-capabilities-error).

| Feature | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| send signals | true |
| exec | true |
| filesystem isolation | none |
| volume mounting | true |

For sending signals, one can use `nomad alloc signal` command.<br/>
For exec'ing into the container, one can use `nomad alloc exec` command.

## Task Configuration

Since docker also relies on containerd for managing container lifecycle, the example job created by [`nomad init -short`][nomad-init] can easily be adapted to use `containerd-driver` instead:

```hcl
job "redis" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]

  group "redis-group" {
    task "redis-task" {
      driver = "containerd-driver"

      config {
        image = "docker.io/library/redis:alpine"
      }

      resources {
        cpu    = 500
        memory = 256
        network {
          mbits = 10
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The containerd task driver supports the following parameters:

- `image` - (Required) OCI image (Docker is also OCI compatible) for your container.

```hcl
config {
  image = "docker.io/library/redis:alpine"
}
```
- `command` - (Optional) Command to override command defined in the image.

```hcl
config {
  command = "some-command"
}
```
- `args` - (Optional) Arguments to the command.

```hcl
config {
  args = [
    "arg1",
    "arg2",
  ]
}
```
- `privileged` - (Optional) `true` or `false` (default) Run container in privileged mode.
Your container will have all linux capabilities when running in privileged mode.

```hcl
config {
  privileged = true
}
```
- `readonly_rootfs` - (Optional) `true` or `false` (default) Container root filesystem will be read-only.
```hcl
config {
  readonly_rootfs = true
}
```
- `cap_add` - (Optional) Add individual capabilities.
```hcl
config {
  cap_add = [
    "CAP_SYS_ADMIN",
    "CAP_CHOWN",
    "CAP_SYS_CHROOT"
  ]
}
```
- `cap_drop` - (Optional) Drop individual capabilities.
```hcl
config {
  cap_drop = [
    "CAP_SYS_ADMIN",
    "CAP_CHOWN",
    "CAP_SYS_CHROOT"
  ]
}
```
- `devices` - (Optional) A list of devices to be exposed to the container.
```hcl
config {
  devices = [
    "/dev/loop0",
    "/dev/loop1"
  ]
}
```
- `mounts` - (Optional) A list of mounts to be mounted in the container.
Volume, bind and tmpfs type mounts are supported. fstab style [`mount options`](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/mount/mount_linux.go#L187-L211) are supported.
   - `type` - (Optional) Supported values are `volume`, `bind` or `tmpfs`. **Default:** `volume`.
   - `target` - (Required) Target path in the container.
   - `source` - (Optional) Source path on the host.
   - `options` - (Optional) fstab style [`mount options`](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/mount/mount_linux.go#L187-L211). **NOTE:** For bind mounts, atleast `rbind` and `ro` are required.
```hcl
config {
  mounts = [
    {
      type = "bind"
      target = "/tmp/t1"
      source = "/tmp/s1"
      options = ["rbind", "ro"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Networking

Networking is [`out-of-scope`](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2017/11/containerd-container-runtime-options-kubernetes/#containerd) for containerd. An external CNI plugin might be needed to support networking.

## Plugin Options ((#plugin_options))

- `enabled` - (Optional) The `containerd` driver may be disabled on hosts by setting this option to `false` (defaults to `true`).

- `containerd_runtime` - (Required) Runtime for `containerd` e.g. `io.containerd.runc.v1` or `io.containerd.runc.v2`

- `stats_interval` - (Optional) This value defines how frequently you want to send `TaskStats` to nomad client. (defaults to `1 second`).


An example of using these plugin options with the new [plugin
syntax][plugin] is shown below:

```hcl
plugin "containerd-driver" {
  config {
    enabled = true
    containerd_runtime = "io.containerd.runc.v2"
    stats_interval = "5s"
  }
}
```

Please note the plugin name should match whatever name you have specified for the external driver in the [plugin_dir][plugin_dir] directory.
