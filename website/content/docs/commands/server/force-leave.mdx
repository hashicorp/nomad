# Command: server force-leave

The `server force-leave` command forces a server to enter the "left" state.
This can be used to eject server nodes which have failed and will not rejoin
the cluster. Note that if the server is actually still alive, it will
eventually rejoin the cluster again.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad server force-leave [options] <node>
```

This command expects only one argument - the node which should be forced
to enter the "left" state.

Additionally, by specifying the `prune` flag, a node can be forcibly removed
from the list of members entirely.

If ACLs are enabled, this option requires a token with the `agent:write`
capability.

## General Options

@include 'general_options_no_namespace.mdx'

## Server Force-Leave Options

- `-prune`: Specifies whether to forcibly remove the node from the list of members. 
Pruning a node in the `left` or `failed` state removes it from the list altogether.

## Examples

Force-leave the server "node1":

```shell-session
$ nomad server force-leave node1

```

Force-leave the server "node1" and prune it:

```shell-session
$ nomad server force-leave -prune node1

```
