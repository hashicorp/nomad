## Introduction

Nomad clients use task drivers to execute a task and provide resource isolation.
Extensible task drivers provide Nomad the flexibility to support a broad
set of workloads across all major operating systems.

Task driver resource isolation provides a degree of separation for Nomad's
client CPU, memory, and storage between tasks. Resource isolation effectiveness
depends upon individual task driver implementations and underlying client
operating systems. Task drivers include various security-related controls but do
not use the Nomad client-to-task interface as a security boundary. Refer to the
[access control guide](/nomad/docs/secure/acl) for more information on
how to protect Nomad cluster operations.
