# Scheduling workloads

Scheduling workloads is a core function of Nomad. It is the process of assigning tasks
from jobs to client machines. The design is heavily inspired by Google's work on
both [Omega: flexible, scalable schedulers for large compute clusters][omega] and
[Large-scale cluster management at Google with Borg][borg]. See the links below
for implementation details on scheduling in Nomad.

- [Scheduling Internals](/nomad/docs/concepts/scheduling/scheduling) - An overview of how the scheduler works.
- [Placement](/nomad/docs/concepts/scheduling/placement) - Explains how placements are computed and how they can be adjusted.
- [Preemption](/nomad/docs/concepts/scheduling/preemption) - Details of preemption, an advanced scheduler feature.
