# Nomad 1.10.x release notes

We are pleased to announce the following Nomad updates.

## 1.10.5 release highlights

### Windows OS enhancements

- Configure Nomad agents to write to the Windows Event Log. Refer to the agent
  configuration's [`eventlog` parameter](/nomad/docs/configuration#eventlog) for
  details.
- Use CLI commands to install and uninstall Nomad as a system service. Refer to
  the following for more information:

    - [`nomad windows service install` command reference](/nomad/commands/windows/service-install)
    - [`nomad windows service uninstall` command reference](/nomad/commands/windows/service-uninstall)


### Keyring configuration validation

On agent startup, Nomad validates [the keyring configuration type](/nomad/docs/configuration/keyring) against supported values.

### Scheduling performance improvement

We improved scheduling performance when checking reserved ports usage.

### Changelog

Review [the changelog](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/releases/tag/v1.10.5)
for a list of bug and security fixes.

## 1.10.4 release highlights

### Nomad logs and journald output

We have added functionality that enables you to retrieve journald output or the
contents of the Nomad log file remotely using the CLI.

#### New monitor export command

For a given Nomad agent, this command retrieves journald logs or the
entire contents of the Nomad log file. Review the [`monitor export` command
reference](/nomad/commands/monitor/export) for usage, options, and examples.

#### Historical log capture for debugging

We added the following flags to the `nomad operator debug` command:

- [`-log-lookback`](/nomad/commands/operator/debug#log-lookback): Include
  historical journald logs in the debug capture.
- [`-log-file-export`](/nomad/commands/operator/debug#log-file-export): Include
  Nomad agents' logfiles in the debug capture.

Refer to the [`nomad operator debug` command
reference](/nomad/commands/operator/debug) for details.

### Blocked evaluation metrics

The `nomad.nomad.blocked_evals.cpu` and `nomad.nomad.blocked_evals.memory`
server metrics now have a `node_pool` label. This helps you determine the node
pool where a scaling operation is needed.

Review the [server metrics in the Metrics reference](/nomad/docs/reference/metrics#server-metrics).

### Sentinel policy scope for CSI volumes <EnterpriseAlert inline />

We added a new `submit-csi-volume` Sentinel policy scope, which lets you apply
Sentinel policies to CSI volume creation and registration.

You may override `soft-mandatory` polices assigned to CSI volume creation and
registration, but you may not override `hard-mandatory` policies. Refer to the
[`EnforcementLevel`
parameter](/nomad/api-docs/sentinel-policies#enforcementlevel) in the Sentinel
Policies API for `soft-mandatory` and `hard-mandatory` definitions.

Refer to the following documentation:

- Sentinel policy reference

  - [submit-csi-volume
    scope](/nomad/docs/reference/sentinel-policy#submit-csi-volume-scope)
  - [Sentinel CSI Volume
    Objects](/nomad/docs/reference/sentinel-policy#sentinel-csi-volume-objects)

- Volumes API reference

  - [Register CSI Volume](/nomad/api-docs/volumes#register-csi-volume)
  - [Create CSI Volume](/nomad/api-docs/volumes#create-csi-volume)

- CLI command reference

  - [`sentinel apply -scope "submit-csi-volume"`](/nomad/commands/sentinel/apply#scope)
  - [`volume create -policy-override` option](/nomad/commands/volume/create#policy-override)
  - [`volume register -policy-override` option](/nomad/commands/volume/register#policy-override)

### Changelog

Review [the changelog](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/releases/tag/v1.10.4) for a list of bug fixes.

## 1.10.3 release highlights

### Consul service registrations

We added the `kind` parameter to the `service` block in the job specification.
You may manually register a Consul service by specifying a Consul service
kind. Refer to the Consul Register Service HTTP API's [Kind
parameter](/consul/api-docs/agent/service#kind) for a list of Consul service
Kind values.

Previously, you configured a Consul service mesh in your job specification's
`gateway` block. Now you may specify the kind of Consul service in the job
specification service itself. If you configure both a service kind and a
gateway in your job specification, the configured Consul service mesh gateway
takes precedence.

Refer to the [job specification `service` block `kind`
parameter](/nomad/docs/job-specification/service#kind) for details.

### Docker task driver cgroup namespace support

You may specify the cgroup namespace in your job specification's Docker task
driver configuration. This lets you run services that require a cgroup
namespace, such as the Datadog Agent.

Refer to the Docker task driver's [`cgroupns`
parameter](/nomad/docs/job-declare/task-driver/docker#cgroupns) for details.

### NOMAD_UNIX_ADDR task environment variable

Use the `NOMAD_UNIX_ADDR` value as your `NOMAD_ADDR` when you want to use the
Nomad CLI with the [task API's](/nomad/api-docs/task-api) Unix socket.

This example sets the `NOMAD_ADDR` to the `NOMAD_UNIX_ADDR` environment
variable.

```hcl
task "nomad-cli" {
  driver = "raw_exec"
  config { ... run `nomad` commands ... }
  identity {
    env = true
  }
  env {
    NOMAD_ADDR = "${NOMAD_UNIX_ADDR}"
  }
}
```

Refer to these resources for details:

- [Nomad CLI environment variables](/nomad/commands#environment-variables)
- Runtime environment settings [job-related
  variables](/nomad/docs/reference/runtime-environment-settings#job-related-variables)
- Runtime variable interpolation [job-related
  variables](/nomad/docs/reference/runtime-variable-interpolation#job-related-variables)

### Changelog

Review [the changelog](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/releases/tag/v1.10.3)
for a list of bug fixes.

## 1.10.2 release highlights

### Start stopped jobs

The `nomad job start` CLI command starts a stopped job. This differs from the
`nomad job restart` command, which restarts or reschedules allocations for a
running job.

Refer to the [`nomad job start` command reference](/nomad/commands/job/start)
for details.

### Dynamic host volumes garbage collection enhancements

When a node is garbage collected, any dynamic host volumes on the node are
orphaned in the state store. You generally don't want to automatically collect
these volumes and risk data loss, so we enhanced garbage collection to let you
delete orphaned dynamic host volumes.

We added the `-force` flag to the `nomad volume delete` command so that you can
delete the volume if the node has been garbage collected. Refer to the [`nomad
volume delete` command reference](/nomad/commands/volume/delete#force) for details.

For clusters running on ephemeral cloud instances, such as AWS
EC2 in an autoscaling group, deleting host volumes may add excessive friction.
The `gc_volumes_on_node_gc` client configuration parameter specifies that the
server should delete any dynamic host volumes on the node when garbage
collection deletes the node. Refer to the [`gc_volumes_on_node_gc` parameter
definition](/nomad/docs/configuration/client#gc_volumes_on_node_gc) for details.

### Configure max number of allocations

The `node_max_allocs` parameter sets the maximum number of allocations that
Nomad may schedule on a client node. Refer to the [`node_max_allocs` parameter
definition](/nomad/docs/configuration/client#node_max_allocs) for details.

### ACL policy with workload identity enhancements

- Apply an ACL policy to a namespace.

  When you apply an ACL policy to a namespace, Nomad applies the policy to all
  the jobs within the namespace. Refer to the [workload-associated ACL policies
  documentation](/nomad/docs/concepts/workload-identity#workload-associated-acl-policies)
  for details.
- Find the ACL policies associated with the current workload identity or ACL
  token.

  This enhancement lets you learn about ACL capabilities from within the
  workload identity tasks.  Refer to the following resources for details:

  - ACL Polices HTTP API [Read Self Policy
    endpoint](/nomad/api-docs/acl/policies#read-self-policy)
  - `nomad acl policy self` [command reference](/nomad/commands/acl/policy/self)
  - `nomad acl token self` [command reference](/nomad/commands/acl/token/self)

### Normalize IPv6 addresses

Apply [RFC-5942 section 4
recommendations](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5952.html#section-4) to IPv6
addresses. Nomad normalizes the addresses when it parses the configuration file
so that the change runs through the whole system.

### Option to render a job specification template only once

We added `once` mode to the `template` block. This allows templates to render
once without watching dependencies. Refer to the following resources for more
information:

- Consul Template Modes [Once
  Mode](/consul/docs/automate/consul-template/mode#once-mode) for a thorough
  description.
- Job specification `template` block's [`once`
  parameter](/nomad/docs/job-specification/template#once) for Nomad behavioral
  changes.

### Offline utilization reporting <EnterpriseAlert inline/>

With this enhancement, Nomad periodically records usage metrics
snapshots in the state store. Cluster administrators in air-gapped or otherwise
secured environments may use the API or CLI to generate utilization reporting
bundles from those usage metrics snapshots.

Refer to the following resources:

- The [Operator Utilization HTTP API](/nomad/api-docs/operator/utilization)
- The [`nomad operator utilization` command
  reference](/nomad/commands/operator/utilization)
- The agent configuration `reporting` block's [`snapshot_retention_time`
  parameter](/nomad/docs/configuration/reporting#snapshot_retention_time)

### Breaking changes

In templates, we removed support for these non-hermetic Sprig functions:
`sprig_date`, `sprig_dateInZone`, `sprig_dateModify`, `sprig_htmlDate`,
`sprig_htmlDateInZone`, `sprig_dateInZone`, `sprig_dateModify`,
`sprig_randAlphaNum`, `sprig_randAlpha`, `sprig_randAscii`, `sprig_randNumeric`,
`sprig_randBytes`, `sprig_uuidv4`, `sprig_env`, `sprig_expandenv`, and
`sprig_getHostByName`.

The aforementioned Sprig functions posed a security risk in that they allowed
reading environment variables or resolving domain names to IP addresses.

### Dynamic host volumes

The dynamic host volumes feature brings a persistent storage option to your
workload allocations.

Nomad dynamic host volumes manage storage for stateful workloads without
requiring a restart of the Nomad nodes to apply configuration changes. You
create dynamic host volumes via the CLI or API and then configure the job with
the [`volume`](/nomad/docs/job-specification/volume) and
[`volume_mount`](/nomad/docs/job-specification/volume_mount) blocks in the job
specification.

Host volumes mount paths from the Nomad client into allocations. Nomad is aware
of host volume availability and makes use of it for job scheduling. However,
Nomad does not know about the volume's underlying characteristics, so you can
use host volumes for both local persistent storage and for highly
available networked storage.

#### Dynamic host volume governance <EnterpriseAlert inline product="nomad"/>

Providing guardrails to platform consumers is an important aspect of the storage
provisioning workflow when leveraging host volumes across a shared Nomad
cluster.  Nomad Enterprise supports these new capabilities to provide
governance when provisioning host volumes:

- **Sentinel dynamic host volume objects**

  During volume creation, Nomad can evaluate all of the details within the
  dynamic host volume specification against Sentinel policies
  that define and enforce specific patterns.

  For example, a policy that enforces the storage tier based on the environment
  or namespace specified would allow reserving more expensive NVME storage for
  specific workloads. Being able to apply policy to the volume specification
  gives you a method to enforce specific patterns while providing platform
  consumers with more flexibility around self-service volume provisioning. Refer
  to the [Sentinel policy reference](/nomad/docs/reference/sentinel-policy#sentinel-dynamic-host-volume-objects) for more information.

- **Resource quota support**

  Nomad’s resource quota system now includes coverage for host volume capacity
  limits that you can apply to provisioned storage within a specific namespace.
  This helps control storage consumption within a namespace based on the maximum
  capacities defined during creation or when making updates to the maximum
  capacities over the lifecycle of the volume. Refer to the [Resource quota
  specification](/nomad/docs/other-specifications/quota) for more information.

- **Namespace and node pool validation**:

  Dynamic host volumes live within the context of a specific namespace when
  created. When Nomad provisions volumes in a namespace targeting a specific
  node pool, Nomad evaluates the namespace node pool configuration to ensure
  that volume creation aligns with job placement rules for node pools. Refer to
  the [Namespace specification](/nomad/docs/other-specifications/namespace) for
  details on `node_pool_config` parameters.

#### Resources

Refer to the following resources to learn more about dynamic host volumes:

- [Host volumes section](/nomad/docs/architecture/storage/stateful-workloads#host-volumes)
  in the _Considerations for stateful workloads_ guide for an overview and
  comparison of storage options
- [Host volumes plugin
  specification](/nomad/docs/architecture/storage/host-volumes) for examples
  of how to write your own plugin to dynamically configure persistent storage on
  your Nomad client nodes
- [Use Nomad dynamic host volumes to persist data for stateful workloads
  tutorial](/nomad/docs/stateful-workloads/dynamic-host-volumes)
  to learn how to create and use a dynamic host volume for persistent storage

### OpenID Connect (OIDC) enhancements

Nomad 1.10 extends Nomad's OIDC SSO login feature with [Private Key JWT][pkjwt]
and [Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)][pkce].

#### Private Key JWT

Private Key JWT, also called client assertions, is a more secure alternative for
client secrets. Instead of sending a simple secret, Nomad builds a JWT and signs
it with a value that the OIDC provider verifies. In this approach, Nomad asserts
a valid OIDC client without sending any secret information over the network.

#### Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)

PKCE adds an extra layer of security to any OIDC auth method for both client
secrets and client assertions.

Set the [ACL auth method `OIDCEnablePKCE`
parameter](/nomad/api-docs/acl/auth-methods#oidcenablepkce) to `true` to turn
on this extra security.

Note that not all OIDC providers support PKCE. In addition to enabling PKCE in
Nomad, you may need to enable it in your OIDC provider's configuration.

#### Resources

- [OIDC auth method guide][oidc-concepts] for details on using OIDC with Nomad
- [OIDC troubleshooting guide][oidc-trouble] to review common issues and tips
  for setting up OIDC
- [Authenticate users with SSO and Keycloak tutorial][oidc-tutorial] to
  configure Nomad and the Keycloak identity provider to automatically grant
  permissions in Nomad ACL.

### Container Storage Interface (CSI) enhancements

We added the following:

- CSI volume and plugin events to the event stream
- Volume capabilities to the `nomad volume status` command output
- The ability to use a volume ID prefix search and wildcard namespace with the
  [`nomad volume delete` command](/nomad/commands/volume/delete). Refer to
  the [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/pull/24997) for
  details. Example usage:

  ```shell-session
  $ nomad volume create ./internal-plugin.volume.hcl
  ==> Created host volume internal-plugin with ID aeea91a0-06df-c16e-5403-ff82a2f28fd4
  ✓ Host volume "aeea91a0" ready

    2025-01-31T15:55:14-05:00
    ID        = aeea91a0-06df-c16e-5403-ff82a2f28fd4
    Name      = internal-plugin
    Namespace = default
    Plugin ID = mkdir
    Node ID   = b4611abd-d4a8-c83a-b05e-7d9f5b44a179
    Node Pool = default
    Capacity  = 0 B
    State     = ready
    Host Path = /run/nomad/dev/data/host_volumes/aeea91a0-06df-c16e-5403-ff82a2f28fd4

  $ nomad volume delete -type host aeea91a0
  Successfully deleted volume "aeea91a0-06df-c16e-5403-ff82a2f28fd4"!
  ```

### UI URL hints added to CLI commands

We added UI URL hints to the end of common CLI commands and a `-ui` flag to
automatically open the generated link in your browser.

Showing UI URL hints is enabled by default. You have two options for turning off
this feature:

- Server: Modify the [`show_cli_hints`
  parameter](/nomad/docs/configuration/ui#show_cli_hints) in your agent's `ui`
  block configuration.
- CLI: Set the `NOMAD_CLI_SHOW_HINTS` environment variable to `0` or `false`.

  ```shell-session
  $ nomad status
  No running jobs

  ==> View and manage Nomad jobs in the Web UI: https://localhost:4646/ui/jobs

  $ export NOMAD_CLI_SHOW_HINTS=0
  $ nomad status
  No running jobs
  ```
