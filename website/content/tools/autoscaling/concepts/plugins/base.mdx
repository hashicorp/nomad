# Base Plugin

The base plugin is an interface required of all autoscaler plugins,
providing a set of common operations.

## Plugin API

#### `PluginInfo() (*PluginInfo, error)`

A `PluginInfo` contains metadata about the plugin. For example,
the Prometheus APM plugin returns the following;

```go
PluginInfo{
    // Name of the plugin
    Name: "prometheus",
    // Plugin type: "apm", "strategy", or "target"
    PluginType: "apm"
}
```

#### `SetConfig(config map[string]string) error`

The `SetConfig` function is called when starting an instance of the plugin. It contains the
configuration for a named instance of the plugin as provided in the autoscaler [agent config][plugin_config].
