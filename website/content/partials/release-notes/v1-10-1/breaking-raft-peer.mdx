#### Remove Raft peer by address removed

Nomad 1.4.0 removed support for Raft Protocol v2, and this removed the ability
to remove Raft peers by address instead of peer ID. Nomad 1.10.1 removes the
non-functional `-peer-address` option for the [`operator raft
peer-remove`](/nomad/commands/operator/raft/remove-peer) command, and the
`address` parameter for the `DELETE /v1/operator/raft/peer` API.
