# Host volume plugins

This page describes the plugin specification for
[dynamic host volumes][stateful-workloads], with examples, so you can write
your own plugin to dynamically configure persistent storage on your Nomad
client nodes.

Review the examples first to get a sense of the specification in action.
A plugin can be as basic as a short shell script.

The full [specification](#specification) is after the examples,
followed by a list of [general considerations](#considerations).

## Examples

The specification is lean enough to be readily fulfilled in any language.
The following examples are written in `bash`.

The `custom-mkdir` plugin creates a directory, and `mkfs-ext4` creates a Linux
filesystem. You may imagine others, such as an NFS mount, perhaps, or various
storage infrastructure APIs.

Each example includes a minimal [volume specification][], which assumes that
you have placed the plugin in the [host volume plugin directory][plugin_dir]
and made it executable.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="custom-mkdir">

`custom-mkdir` only creates a directory. There is a plugin built into Nomad that
does this called "mkdir", but this serves as a minimal example.

Volume specification:
```hcl
type      = "host"
name      = "mkdir-vol"
plugin_id = "custom-mkdir" # plugin filename
```

Plugin code:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# set -u to error by name if an env var is not set
set -eu

# echo to stderr, because Nomad expects stdout to match the spec.
# this (and stdout) show up in Nomad agent debug logs.
stderr() {
  1>&2 echo "$@"
}

get_path() {
  # since delete runs `rm -rf` (frightening), check to make sure
  # the path is something sensible.
  if [ -z "$DHV_VOLUMES_DIR" ]; then
    stderr "DHV_VOLUMES_DIR must not be empty"
    exit 1
  fi
  if [ -z "$DHV_VOLUME_NAME" ]; then
    stderr "DHV_VOLUME_NAME must not be empty"
    exit 1
  fi
  # create and delete assign this echo output to a variable
  echo "$DHV_VOLUMES_DIR/$DHV_VOLUME_NAME"
}

case "$DHV_OPERATION" in
  "fingerprint")
    echo '{"version": "0.0.1"}'
    ;;
  "create")
    path="$(get_path)"
    stderr "creating directory: $path"
    # `mkdir -p` may be run repeatedly with the same result;
    # it is idempotent.
    mkdir -p "$path"
    # 0 bytes because plain directories are not any particular size.
    printf '{"path": "%s", "bytes": 0}' "$path"
    ;;
  "delete")
    path="$(get_path)"
    stderr "deleting directory: $path"
    rm -rf "$path" # `rm -f` is also idempotent.
    ;;
  *)
    echo "unknown operation: '$DHV_OPERATION'"
    exit 1
    ;;
esac
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="mkfs-ext4">

`mkfs-ext4` creates a Linux ext4 filesystem with the `mkfs.ext4` command and
mounts it  as a loopback device. Unlike `mkdir`, `mkfs` can restrict the size
of the volume.

Volume specification:
```hcl
type         = "host"
name         = "mkfs-vol"
plugin_id    = "mkfs-ext4" # plugin filename
capacity_min = "50MB" # capacity values are required by this plugin
capacity_max = "50MB"
```

Plugin code:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

version='0.0.1'

stderr() {
  1>&2 echo "$@"
}

get_path() {
  if [ -z "$DHV_VOLUMES_DIR" ]; then
    stderr "DHV_VOLUMES_DIR must not be empty"
    exit 1
  fi
  if [ -z "$DHV_VOLUME_NAME" ]; then
    stderr "DHV_VOLUME_NAME must not be empty"
    exit 1
  fi
  echo "$DHV_VOLUMES_DIR/$DHV_VOLUME_NAME"
}

is_mounted() {
  mount | grep -q " $1 "
}

create_volume() {
    local path="$1"
    local bytes="$2"

    # translate to mb for dd block size
    local megs=$((bytes / 1024 / 1024)) # lazy, approximate
    if [ $megs -le 0 ]; then
      stderr "minimum capacity must be greater than zero."
      exit 2
    fi

    mkdir -p "$path"
    # the if statements ensure idempotency
    if [ ! -f "$path.ext4" ]; then
      # dd only writes to stderr, so safe to run without redirection
      dd if=/dev/zero of="$path.ext4" bs=1M count="$megs"
      # mkfs includes stdout, so we need to redirect that to stderr
      mkfs.ext4 "$path.ext4" 1>&2
    fi
    if ! is_mounted "$path"; then
      mount "$path.ext4" "$path"
    fi
}

delete_volume() {
  local path="$1"
  is_mounted "$path" && umount "$path"
  rm -rf "$path"
  rm -f "$path.ext4"
}

case "$1" in
  "fingerprint")
    printf '{"version": "%s"}' "$version"
    ;;
  "create")
    path="$(get_path)"
    stderr "creating volume at $path"
    create_volume "$path" "$DHV_CAPACITY_MIN_BYTES"
    # output what Nomad expects
    bytes="$(stat --format='%s' "$path.ext4")"
    printf '{"path": "%s", "bytes": %s}' "$path" "$bytes"
    ;;
  "delete")
    path="$(get_path)"
    stderr "deleting volume at $path"
    delete_volume "$path" ;;
  *)
    echo "unknown operation: $1"
    exit 1 ;;
esac

## Specification

A host volume plugin is registered with Nomad if it:

* Is an executable file (a script or binary)
* Is located in the [`client.host_volume_plugin_dir`][plugin_dir] directory
  on Nomad client nodes
* Responds appropriately to a `fingerprint` call

### Operations

To fully manage the lifecycle of a volume, plugins must fulfill all of the
following operations:

* [fingerprint](#fingerprint)
* [create](#create)
* [delete](#delete)

Nomad passes the operation as the first positional argument to the plugin.
That and other information are passed as environment variables. Environment
variables are prefixed with `"DHV_"` (i.e. Dynamic Host Volume).

Some variables may be required for certain plugins (namely, `DHV_CAPACITY_*`
for plugins that can restrict size). Most are for plugin author convenience.

#### fingerprint
<blockquote style={{borderLeft: "solid 1px #00ca8e"}}>

Nomad calls `fingerprint` when the client agent starts (or is reloaded with a
SIGHUP) to discover valid plugins. The returned "version" is used to register
the plugin on the Nomad node for volume scheduling.

**CLI arguments:** `$1=fingerprint`

**Environment variables:**

```
DHV_OPERATION=fingerprint
```

**Expected stdout:**

```
{"version": "0.0.1"}
```

**Requirements:**

* Must complete within 5 seconds, or Nomad will kill it. It should be much
  faster, as no actual work should be done.
* "version" value must be valid per the [hashicorp/go-version][go-version]
  golang package.

</blockquote>

#### create
<blockquote style={{borderLeft: "solid 1px #00ca8e"}}>

Nomad calls `create` when you run [`nomad volume create`][cli-create] CLI or
use the [create API][api-create]).

You can run `create` again for the same volume if you include the volume
`id` in the volume specification.

Nomad also calls `create` when the agent starts, for each volume that was
previously created on the node, so plugins can ensure the volumes are available
after an agent restart or host reboot.

**CLI Arguments:** `$1=create`

**Environment variables:**

```
DHV_OPERATION=create
DHV_VOLUMES_DIR={directory to put the volume in}
DHV_PLUGIN_DIR={path to directory containing plugins}
DHV_NAMESPACE={volume namespace}
DHV_VOLUME_NAME={name from the volume specification}
DHV_VOLUME_ID={volume ID generated by Nomad}
DHV_NODE_ID={Nomad node ID}
DHV_NODE_POOL={Nomad node pool}
DHV_CAPACITY_MIN_BYTES={capacity_min from the volume spec, expressed in bytes}
DHV_CAPACITY_MAX_BYTES={capacity_max from the volume spec, expressed in bytes}
DHV_PARAMETERS={stringified json of parameters from the volume spec}
```

**Expected stdout:**

```
{"path": "/path/to/created/volume", "bytes": 50000000}
```

**Requirements:**

* Must complete within 60 seconds, or Nomad will kill it.
* Must create a path on disk, within `DHV_VOLUMES_DIR` or otherwise, and return
  it as `"path"`. Nomad will mount this path into workloads that request the
  volume, and it will also be sent to `delete` later as `DHV_CREATED_PATH`.
* Must be idempotent - running create with the same inputs should produce the
  same result.
* Must be safe to run concurrently, per volume name per node.
* If the plugin fails partway through create, it must clean up after itself
  and exit non-0. Nomad will not attempt to delete partial creates.
* However, if during an _initial_ create, Nomad fails to save the volume in its
  own state, it will issue `delete` automatically to avoid leaving any
  stray volumes on disk.

</blockquote>

#### delete
<blockquote style={{borderLeft: "solid 1px #00ca8e"}}>

Nomad calls `delete` when you run [`nomad volume delete`][cli-delete] CLI or
use the [delete API][api-delete].

**CLI Arguments:** `$1=delete`

**Environment variables:**

```
DHV_OPERATION=delete
DHV_CREATED_PATH={path that `create` returned}
DHV_VOLUMES_DIR={directory that volumes should be put in}
DHV_PLUGIN_DIR={path to directory containing plugins}
DHV_NAMESPACE={volume namespace}
DHV_VOLUME_NAME={name from the volume specification}
DHV_VOLUME_ID={volume ID generated by Nomad}
DHV_NODE_ID={Nomad node ID}
DHV_NODE_POOL={Nomad node pool}
DHV_PARAMETERS={stringified json of parameters from the volume spec}
```

**Expected stdout:** none (stdout is discarded)

**Requirements:**

* Must complete within 60 seconds, or Nomad will kill it.
* Must remove the `DHV_CREATED_PATH` that was returned by `create`,
  or derive the path from other variables the same way that `create` did.
* Must be idempotent - calling delete on an already deleted volume must not
  return an error.
* Must be safe to run concurrently, per volume name per node.
* Will be run after a failed `create` operation during initial volume creation.

</blockquote>

## Considerations

Plugin authors should consider these details when writing plugins.

### Execution

* The plugin is executed as the same user as the `nomad` agent (likely root).
* Plugin `stdout` and `stderr` are exposed as client agent debug logs,
  so plugins should not output sensitive information.
* Nomad does not retry automatically on error. The caller of create/delete
  must retry manually. The plugin may do so internally with its own retry
  logic, provided it still completes within the deadline.
* Errors from `create` while restoring a volume during Nomad agent start
  do not halt the client. The error will be in client logs, and the volume
  is not registered as available on the node.

### Uniqueness

* Volume `name` is unique per _node_, and volume `ID` is unique per _region_.
* Only one create/delete operation at a time is executed per volume `name`
  per node, and similarly by `id` on Nomad servers, but many create/delete
  operations for different volume IDs may run concurrently, even on the same
  node.
* We suggest placing volumes in `DHV_VOLUMES_DIR` for consistency, but it is not
  required. Often `$DHV_VOLUMES_DIR/$DVH_VOLUME_NAME` will suffice, as the
  volume `name` is unique per node, or `$DHV_VOLUMES_DIR/$DHV_VOLUME_ID` for
  uniqueness per Nomad region.
* Plugins that write into network storage need to take care not to delete
  remote/shared state by `name`, unless they know that there are no other
  volumes with workloads using that name.

### Configuration

* Per-_volume_ configuration should be set in the volume specification file's
  `parameters`. Per-_node_ configuration should be put in config file(s) as
  described next.
* There is no mechanism built into Nomad for plugin configuration. As a
  convention, we suggest placing any necessary configuration file(s) next to
  the executable plugin in the plugin directory. You may use `DHV_PLUGIN_DIR`
  to refer to the directory.
* If a plugin needs to retain state across operations (e.g. delete needs
  some value that was generated during create), then you may store that on
  the host filesystem, or some external data store of your choosing, perhaps
  even Nomad variables.
