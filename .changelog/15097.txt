```release-note:breaking-change
core: Ensure no leakage of evaluations for batch jobs. Prior to this change allocations and evaluations for batch jobs were never garbage collected until the batch job was explicitly stopped. The new `batch_eval_gc_threshold` server configuration controls how often they are collected. The default threshold is `24h`.
