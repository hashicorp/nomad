# Command: job scale

The `job scale` command is used to alter the number of running allocations within
a Nomad task group.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad job scale [options] <job> <group> <count>
```

The `job scale` commands requires at least two arguments and potentially three
depending on the job specification. The first argument will be the job ID of the
job you wish to scale. If the job contains a single task group, you can omit
including the task group name as the second argument and the command will perform
the required lookup. The final argument is the count that you wish the job task
group to be changed to. The count is the absolute value that will be reflected in
the job specification.

Scale will issue a request to update the matched job and then invoke an interactive
monitor that exits automatically once the scheduler has processed the request.
It is safe to exit the monitor early using ctrl+c.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the `scale-job`
capability for the job's namespace.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Scale Options

- `-detach`: Return immediately instead of entering monitor mode. After the
  scale command is submitted, a new evaluation ID is printed to the screen,
  which can be used to examine the evaluation using the [eval status] command.

- `-verbose`: Show full information.

## Examples

Scale the job with ID "job1" which contains a single task group to a count of 8:

```shell-session
$ nomad job scale job1 8
==> Monitoring evaluation "529cc88e"
    Evaluation triggered by job "job1"
    Evaluation within deployment: "28a3378f"
    Allocation "2a4df8ca" created: node "2f0a2f93", group "group1"
    Allocation "b7eefe49" created: node "2f0a2f93", group "group1"
    Allocation "bd54a83d" created: node "2f0a2f93", group "group1"
    Allocation "fadeaea8" created: node "2f0a2f93", group "group1"
    Allocation "4bd1397b" modified: node "2f0a2f93", group "group1"
    Allocation "93684511" modified: node "2f0a2f93", group "group1"
    Allocation "b409f0a2" modified: node "2f0a2f93", group "group1"
    Allocation "18f50054" created: node "2f0a2f93", group "group1"
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "529cc88e" finished with status "complete"
```

Scale the job with ID "job1" which contains a single task group to a count of 8
and return immediately:

```shell-session
$ nomad job scale -detach job1 8
Evaluation ID: b754d6b3-8960-5652-60d8-d47df6eaed13
```

Scale the job with ID "job1" and the task group "group1" to a count of 8:

```shell-session
$ nomad job scale job1 group1 8
==> Monitoring evaluation "529cc88e"
    Evaluation triggered by job "job1"
    Evaluation within deployment: "28a3378f"
    Allocation "2a4df8ca" created: node "2f0a2f93", group "group1"
    Allocation "b7eefe49" created: node "2f0a2f93", group "group1"
    Allocation "bd54a83d" created: node "2f0a2f93", group "group1"
    Allocation "fadeaea8" created: node "2f0a2f93", group "group1"
    Allocation "4bd1397b" modified: node "2f0a2f93", group "group1"
    Allocation "93684511" modified: node "2f0a2f93", group "group1"
    Allocation "b409f0a2" modified: node "2f0a2f93", group "group1"
    Allocation "18f50054" created: node "2f0a2f93", group "group1"
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "529cc88e" finished with status "complete"
```
