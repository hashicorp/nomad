# Command: license get

The `license get` command is used to retrieve the current Nomad Enterprise
license. The command is not forwarded to the Nomad leader, and will return
the license from the specific server being contacted.

~> License commands are new in Nomad 0.12.0 and are only available with Nomad
Enterprise.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad license get [options]
```

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the 'operator:read'
capability.

## General Options

@include 'general_options_no_namespace.mdx'
