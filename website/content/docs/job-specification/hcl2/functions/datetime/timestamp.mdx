# `timestamp` Function

`timestamp` returns the current date and time.

In the Nomad language, timestamps are conventionally represented as
strings using [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339)
"Date and Time format" syntax, and so `timestamp` returns a string
in this format.

The result of this function will change every second, so using this function
directly with job attributes will cause a diff to be detected on every
Nomad job submission.

## Examples

```shell-session
> timestamp()
2018-05-13T07:44:12Z
```

## Related Functions

- [`formatdate`](/docs/job-specification/hcl2/functions/datetime/formatdate) can convert the resulting timestamp to
  other date and time formats.
