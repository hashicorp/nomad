# Command: job init

**Alias: `nomad init`**

The `job init` command creates an example [job specification][jobspec] in the
current directory that demonstrates some common configurations for tasks, task
groups, runtime constraints, and resource allocation.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad job init [options] [filename]
```

You may optionally supply a filename for the example job to be written to. The
default filename for the generated file is "example.nomad".

Please refer to the [jobspec] and [drivers] pages to learn how to customize the
template.

## Init Options

- `-short`: If set, a minimal jobspec without comments is emitted.
- `-connect`: If set, the jobspec includes Consul Connect integration.

## Examples

Generate an example job file:

```shell-session
$ nomad job init
Example job file written to example.nomad
```
