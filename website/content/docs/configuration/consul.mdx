# `consul` Block

<Placement groups={['consul']} />

The `consul` block configures the Nomad agent's communication with
[Consul][consul] for service discovery and key-value integration. When
configured, tasks can register themselves with Consul, and the Nomad cluster can
[automatically bootstrap][bootstrap] itself.

```hcl
consul {
  address = "127.0.0.1:8500"
  auth    = "admin:password"
  token   = "abcd1234"
}
```

A default `consul` block is automatically merged with all Nomad agent
configurations. These sane defaults automatically enable Consul integration if
Consul is detected on the system. This allows for seamless bootstrapping of the
cluster with zero configuration. To put it another way: if you have a Consul
agent running on the same host as the Nomad agent with the default
configuration, Nomad will automatically connect and configure with Consul.

~> An important requirement is that each Nomad agent talks to a unique Consul
agent. Nomad agents should be configured to talk to Consul agents and not
Consul servers. If you are observing flapping services, you may have
multiple Nomad agents talking to the same Consul agent. As such avoid
configuring Nomad to talk to Consul via DNS such as consul.service.consul

In Nomad Enterprise, you may specify multiple `consul` blocks to configure
access to multiple Consul clusters. Each Consul cluster must have a different
value for the [`name`](#name) field.

## `consul` Parameters

- `address` `(string: "127.0.0.1:8500")` - Specifies the address to the local
  Consul agent, given in the format `host:port`. Supports Unix sockets with the
  format: `unix:///tmp/consul/consul.sock`. Will default to the
  `CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR` environment variable if set.
  The value supports [go-sockaddr/template format][go-sockaddr/template].

- `allow_unauthenticated` `(bool: true)` - Specifies if users submitting jobs to
  the Nomad server should be required to provide their own Consul token, proving
  they have access to the service identity policies required by the Consul Connect
  enabled services listed in the job. This option should be
  disabled in an untrusted environment.

- `auth` `(string: "")` - Specifies the HTTP Basic Authentication information to
  use for access to the Consul Agent, given in the format `username:password`.

- `auto_advertise` `(bool: true)` - Specifies if Nomad should advertise its
  services in Consul. The services are named according to `server_service_name`
  and `client_service_name`. Nomad servers and clients advertise their
  respective services, each tagged appropriately with either `http` or `rpc`
  tag. Nomad servers also advertise a `serf` tagged service.

- `grpc_ca_file` `(string: "")` - Specifies an optional path to the GRPC CA
   certificate used for communication between Connect sidecar proxies and Consul
   agents. Will default to the `CONSUL_GRPC_CACERT` environment variable if set.

- `ca_file` `(string: "")` - Specifies an optional path to the CA certificate
  used for Consul communication. This defaults to the system bundle if
  unspecified. Will default to the `CONSUL_CACERT` environment variable if set.

- `cert_file` `(string: "")` - Specifies the path to the certificate used for
  Consul communication. If this is set then you need to also set `key_file`.

- `checks_use_advertise` `(bool: false)` - Specifies if Consul health checks
  should bind to the advertise address. By default, this is the first [HTTP
  address](/nomad/docs/configuration#http). If no
  [HTTP address](/nomad/docs/configuration#http) is
  specified, it will fall back to the
  [bind_addr](/nomad/docs/configuration#bind_addr).

- `client_auto_join` `(bool: true)` - Specifies if the Nomad clients should
  automatically discover servers in the same region by searching for the Consul
  service name defined in the `server_service_name` option. The search occurs if
  the client is not registered with any servers or it is unable to heartbeat to
  the leader of the region, in which case it may be partitioned and searches for
  other servers.

- `client_service_name` `(string: "nomad-client")` - Specifies the name of the
  service in Consul for the Nomad clients.

- `client_http_check_name` `(string: "Nomad Client HTTP Check")` - Specifies the
  HTTP health check name in Consul for the Nomad clients.

- `grpc_address` `(string: "127.0.0.1:8502")` - Specifies the address to the local
  Consul agent for `gRPC` requests, given in the format `host:port`. Note that
  Consul does not enable the [`grpc`][grpc_port] or [`grpc_tls`][grpctls_port]
  listeners by default.

- `key_file` `(string: "")` - Specifies the path to the private key used for
  Consul communication. If this is set then you need to also set `cert_file`.

- `name` `(string: "default")` <EnterpriseAlert inline/> - Specifies a name for
  the cluster so it can be referred to by job submitters in the job
  specification's [`consul.cluster`][] or [`service.cluster`][] fields. In Nomad
  Community Edition, only the `"default"` cluster will be used, so this field
  should be omitted.

- `namespace` `(string: "")` - Specifies the [Consul namespace](/consul/docs/enterprise/namespaces)
  used by the Consul integration. If non-empty, this namespace will be used on
  all Consul API calls and for Consul Connect configurations.

- `server_service_name` `(string: "nomad")` - Specifies the name of the service
  in Consul for the Nomad servers.

- `server_http_check_name` `(string: "Nomad Server HTTP Check")` - Specifies the
  HTTP health check name in Consul for the Nomad servers.

- `server_serf_check_name` `(string: "Nomad Server Serf Check")` - Specifies
  the Serf health check name in Consul for the Nomad servers.

- `server_rpc_check_name` `(string: "Nomad Server RPC Check")` - Specifies
  the RPC health check name in Consul for the Nomad servers.

- `server_auto_join` `(bool: true)` - Specifies if the Nomad servers should
  automatically discover and join other Nomad servers by searching for the
  Consul service name defined in the `server_service_name` option. This search
  only happens if the server does not have a leader.

- `service_auth_method` `(string: "nomad-services")` - Specifies the name of the
  Consul [authentication method][auth-method] that will be used to login with a
  Nomad JWT for services.

- `service_identity` <code>([Identity][identity_block]: nil)</code> - Specifies
  a default Workload Identity to use when obtaining Service Identity tokens from
  Consul to register services. Refer to [Workload Identity](#workload-identity)
  for a recommended configuration.

- `share_ssl` `(bool: true)` - Specifies whether the Nomad client should share
  its Consul SSL configuration with Connect Native applications. Includes values
  of `ca_file`, `cert_file`, `key_file`, `ssl`, and `verify_ssl`. Does not include
  the values for the ACL `token` or `auth`. This option should be disabled in
  environments where Consul ACLs are not enabled.

- `ssl` `(bool: false)` - Specifies if the transport scheme should use HTTPS to
  communicate with the Consul agent. Will default to the `CONSUL_HTTP_SSL`
  environment variable if set.

- `tags` `(array<string>: [])` - Specifies optional Consul tags to be
  registered with the Nomad server and agent services.

- `task_auth_method` `(string: "nomad-tasks")` - Specifies the name of the
  Consul [authentication method][auth-method] that will be used to login with a
  Nomad JWT for tasks.

- `task_identity` <code>([Identity][identity_block]: nil)</code> - Specifies a
  default Workload Identity to use when obtaining Consul tokens from Consul to
  support [`template`][] blocks. Refer to [Workload
  Identity](#workload-identity) for a recommended configuration.

- `timeout` `(string: "5s")` - Specifies a time limit for requests made against
  Consul. This is specified using a label suffix like "10s".

- `token` `(string: "")` - Specifies the token used to provide a per-request ACL
  token. This option overrides the Consul Agent's default token. If the token is
  not set here or on the Consul agent, it will default to Consul's anonymous policy,
  which may or may not allow writes. Will default to the `CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN`
  environment variable if set.

- `verify_ssl` `(bool: true)`- Specifies if SSL peer verification should be used
  when communicating to the Consul API client over HTTPS. Will default to the
  `CONSUL_HTTP_SSL_VERIFY` environment variable if set.

If the local Consul agent is configured and accessible by the Nomad agents, the
Nomad cluster will [automatically bootstrap][bootstrap] provided
`server_auto_join`, `client_auto_join`, and `auto_advertise` are all enabled
(which is the default).

## `consul` Examples

### Default

This example shows the default Consul integration:

```hcl
consul {
  address             = "127.0.0.1:8500"
  server_service_name = "nomad"
  client_service_name = "nomad-client"
  auto_advertise      = true
  server_auto_join    = true
  client_auto_join    = true
}
```

### Workload Identity

The `service_identity` and `task_identity` blocks accept all the same values as
the job specification's [`identity`][identity_block] (except that the
`service_identity` ignores the `env` and `file` fields). By ensuring these
blocks are set on the Nomad servers, you can automatically migrate your existing
jobs to use Workload Identity without modifying the job specification and
resubmitting them.

The recommended configuration for `service_identity` and `task_identity` is as
follows. See [Migrating to Using Workload Identity with Consul][] for details on
how to configure Consul to accept these identities. Note that the `ttl` field
here refers to the TTL of the Nomad identity and not the Consul token.

```hcl
consul {
  service_identity {
    aud = ["consul.io"]
    ttl = "1h"
  }

  task_identity {
    aud = ["consul.io"]
    ttl = "1h"
  }
}
```

### Custom Address and Port

This example shows pointing the Nomad agent at a different Consul address. Note
that you should **never** point directly at a Consul server; always point to a
local client. In this example, the Consul server is bound and listening on the
node's private IP address instead of localhost, so we use that:

```hcl
consul {
  address = "10.0.2.4:8500"
}
```

### Custom SSL

This example shows configuring custom SSL certificates to communicate with
the Consul agent. The Consul agent should be configured to accept certificates
similarly, but that is not discussed here:

```hcl
consul {
  ssl       = true
  ca_file   = "/var/ssl/bundle/ca.bundle"
  cert_file = "/etc/ssl/consul.crt"
  key_file  = "/etc/ssl/consul.key"
}
```

### Consul Namespace

Consul does not allow ACL policies associated with namespaces to use agent
permissions. Nomad requires `agent:read` permissions. In order to use the
`consul_namespace` feature, Nomad will need a token generated in Consul's
default namespace. That token should be created with `agent:read` as well
as a `namespace` block with the other relevant permissions for running Nomad
in the intended namespace. The Consul policy below shows an example policy
configuration for a Nomad server:

```hcl
agent_prefix "" {
  policy = "read"
}

namespace "nomad-ns" {
  acl = "write"

  key_prefix "" {
    policy = "read"
  }

  node_prefix "" {
    policy = "read"
  }

  service_prefix "" {
    policy = "write"
  }
}
```
