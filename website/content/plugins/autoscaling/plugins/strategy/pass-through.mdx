# Pass-Through Strategy Plugin

The `pass-through` strategy is a very simple, yet useful strategy. It does not
add any extra computation on top of the metric query result, and instead uses
the APM query result as the scaling count. It doesn't have any configuration
options.

This allows the Nomad Autoscaler to be integrated into systems where the
scaling computation is done externally like an edge router, or easily derived
from a query such as running one allocation per item in a queue.

## Agent Configuration Options

```hcl
strategy "pass-through" {
  driver = "pass-through"
}
```

## Policy Configuration Options

```hcl
check "pass-through-check" {
  # ...
  strategy "pass-through" {}
  # ...
}
```

The `pass-through` plugin doesn't have any configuration.
