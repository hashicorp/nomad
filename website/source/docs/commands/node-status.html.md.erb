# Command: node-status

The `node-status` command is used to display information about client nodes. A
node must first be registered with the servers before it will be visible in this
output.

## Usage

```
nomad node-status [options] [node]
```

If no node ID is passed, then the command will enter "list mode" and dump a
high-level list of all known nodes. This list output contains less information
but is a good way to get a bird's-eye view of things.

If there is an exact match based on the provided node ID or prefix, then that
particular node will be queried, and detailed information will be displayed.
Otherwise, a list of matching nodes and information will be displayed.

## General Options

<%= general_options_usage %>

## Node Status Options

* `-short`: Display short output. Used only when querying a single node. Drops
  verbose information about node allocations.
* `-verbose`: Show full information.

## Examples

List view:

```
$ nomad node-status
ID        DC   Name   Drain  Status
a72dfba2  dc1  node1  false  ready
1f3f03ea  dc1  node2  false  ready
```

Single-node view in short mode:

```
$ nomad node-status -short 1f3f03ea
ID         = 1f3f03ea
Name       = node2
Class      =
Datacenter = dc1
Drain      = false
Status     = ready
```

Full output for a single node:

```
$ nomad node-status 1f3f03ea
ID         = 1f3f03ea
Name       = node2
Class      =
Datacenter = dc1
Drain      = false
Status     = ready
