# Nomad plugin authoring guide

Nomad implements a plugin framework which lets you extend the functionality of
some components within Nomad. The design of the plugin system is inspired by the
lessons learned from plugin systems implemented in other HashiCorp products such
as Terraform and Vault.

The following components are currently pluggable within Nomad:

- [Task drivers](/nomad/docs/plugins/task-driver)
- [Device drivers](/nomad/plugins/device-driver)

## Architecture

The Nomad plugin framework uses the [go-plugin][goplugin] project to expose
a language independent plugin interface. Plugins implement a set of gRPC
services and methods which Nomad manages by running the plugin and calling the
implemented RPCs. This means that plugins are free to be implemented in the
author's language of choice.

To facilitate plugin development, a set of go interfaces and structs exist for
each plugin type that abstract away go-plugin and the gRPC interface. The
guides in this documentation reference these abstractions for ease of use.
