  Register CSI volumes or dynamic host volumes.

# Command: volume register

The `volume register` command registers storage volumes as either [Container
Storage Interface (CSI)][csi] volumes or dynamic host volumes. The volume must
already exist on a node or remote storage provider before it can be registered
and used by a task.

To instead create a volume that does not already exist, use the [`volume
create`][] command. The `volume create` command automatically registers the
volume as well.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad volume register [options] [file]
```

The `volume register` command requires a single argument, specifying the path to a
file containing a valid [volume specification][volume_specification]. Nomad
reads the file and submits the volume to the server for placement. If the
supplied path is "-", the volume file is read from STDIN. Otherwise the file is
read from the file at the supplied path.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the appropriate
capability in the volume's namespace: the `csi-write-volume` capability for CSI
volumes or `host-volume-register` for dynamic host volumes.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Volume Register Options

- `-policy-override`: Sets the flag to force override any soft mandatory
  Sentinel policies. Used for dynamic host volumes only. Not valid for CSI
  volumes.

## Volume Specification

The volume specification for CSI is documented in the [CSI Volume
Specification][csi_vol_spec] page. The volume specification for dynamic host
volumes is documented in the [Dynamic Host Volume Specification](host_vol_spec)
page.

The `volume register` command allows updating a volume definition. But not all
fields can be updated after the volume is registered.

For CSI volumes:

* The `capacity_min` and `capacity_max` fields can be updated, and may increase
  the volume size if the CSI plugin supports it. Expansion may or may not be
  possible while the volume is in use, again depending on the plugin.
  Reducing volume capacity is not allowed per the CSI spec.
* The `capability` blocks can be added or removed, but only if the capability is
  not currently in use by a mounted volume.
* The `mount_options` block can be updated if the volume is not in use.
* The `secrets` block can be updated.
* The `context` block can be updated. The values for this field are typically
  provided by the CSI plugin, and should not be updated unless recommended by
  the CSI plugin's documentation.

For dynamic host volumes:

* The `name`, `type`, and `plugin_id` fields cannot be updated.
* The `node_id` field cannot be updated. The `node_pool` field can only be
  changed from empty to the node pool that matches the `node_id` field.
* The `capacity_min` and `capacity_max` fields can be updated, and may increase
  the volume size if the plugin supports it. Expansion may or may not be
  possible while the volume is in use, again depending on the plugin.
  Reducing volume capacity is not allowed.
* The `capacity` field can be updated only for volume registration.
* The `constraint` fields can be updated but are ignored after the volume is created.
* The `capability` blocks can be added or removed, but only if the capability is
  not currently in use by a mounted volume.
