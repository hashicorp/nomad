Nomad uses one of three values to describe a job's status.

- `complete`
- `dead`
- `running`

The CLI returns these rigid statuses, which are useful for scheduling and
garbage collection. However, the Nomad UI displays additional human-readable
statuses to help you manage jobs.

The following table maps the CLI statuses to the statuses that appear in the Nomad UI.

| CLI status | UI status |
| ---------- | --------- |
| `dead`      | `Complete`    |
| `dead`           | `Failed`, `Scaled Down` |
| `dead (stopped)` | `Stopped` |
| `running`        | `Degraded`, `Deploying`, `Healthy`, `Recovering`, `Running`, `Scaled Down` |
