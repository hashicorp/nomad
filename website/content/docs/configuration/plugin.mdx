<Placement groups={['plugin']} />

This page provides reference information for configuring task driver and device
driver plugins in the `plugin` block of a Nomad agent configuration. Specify
arguments to pass to the plugin. Configure values specific to the plugin.

Refer to the [Nomad plugins guide](/nomad/plugins) for details on specific task
driver and device plugins.

```hcl
plugin "example-plugin" {
    args = ["-my-flag"]
    config {
       foo = "bar"
       bam {
         baz = 1
       }
    }
}
```

The name of the plugin is the plugin's executable name relative to to the
[plugin_dir](/nomad/docs/configuration#plugin_dir). If the plugin has a
suffix, such as `.exe`, this should be omitted.
