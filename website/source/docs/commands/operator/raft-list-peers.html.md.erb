# Command: operator raft list-peers

The Raft list-peers command is used to display the current Raft peer
configuration.

See the [Outage Recovery](/guides/operations/outage.html) guide for some examples of how
this command is used. For an API to perform these operations programmatically,
please see the documentation for the [Operator](/api/operator.html)
endpoint.

## Usage

```
nomad operator raft list-peers [options]
```

## General Options

<%= partial "docs/commands/_general_options" %>

## List Peers Options

* `-stale`: The stale argument defaults to "false" which means the leader
provides the result. If the cluster is in an outage state without a leader, you
may need to set `-stale` to "true" to get the configuration from a non-leader
server.

## Examples

An example output with three servers is as follows:

```
$ nomad operator raft list-peers
Node                   ID               Address          State     Voter
nomad-server01.global  10.10.11.5:4647  10.10.11.5:4647  follower  true
nomad-server02.global  10.10.11.6:4647  10.10.11.6:4647  leader    true
nomad-server03.global  10.10.11.7:4647  10.10.11.7:4647  follower  true
```

- `Node` is the node name of the server, as known to Nomad, or "(unknown)" if
the node is stale and not known.

- `ID` is the ID of the server. This is the same as the `Address` but may  be
upgraded to a GUID in a future version of Nomad.

- `Address` is the IP:port for the server.

- `State` is either "follower" or "leader" depending on the server's role in the
Raft configuration.

- `Voter` is "true" or "false", indicating if the server has a vote in the Raft
configuration. Future versions of Nomad may add support for non-voting servers.
