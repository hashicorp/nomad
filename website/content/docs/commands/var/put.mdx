# Command: var put

The `var put` command writes the secure variable to the given path in Nomad.
Items to be stored in the variable can be provided as key-value pairs after the
path or using one of the file input optionsâ€”standard input or @-prefixed
filenames.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad var put [options] <path> [<key>=value]...
```

If ACLs are enabled, this command requires a management ACL token or a token
that has a capability associated with the namespace.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Output Options

- `-field` `(string: "")`: Print only the field with the given name. Specifying
  this option will take precedence over other formatting directives. The result
  will not have a trailing newline making it ideal for piping to other
  processes.

- `-of` `(string: varies)`: Print the output in the given format. Valid
  formats are `none`, `table`, `json`, `hcl`, or `go-template`. Defaults to
  `none` when the output is a terminal; defaults to `json` when the output is
  redirected.

- `-q` - Silence all non-error output. This flag overrides any value set using
  the `-of` option.

## Command Options

- `-check-index` `(int: varies)`: If set, the secure variable is only updated if
  the provided index matches the server side version's modify index. If a
  check-index value of zero is set, the secure variable is only inserted if it
  does not yet exist. This value defaults to the value provided in the variable
  specification or to zero when a specification is not provided.

- `-if` `(string: "json")`: Specify the format of data read from standard input
  and from files without the format-specifying extensions, ".hcl" or ".json".
  Valid formats are `json` or `hcl`.

- `-y`: Answer yes to all confirmation prompts.

## Examples

Writes the data to the path "secret/creds":

```shell-session
$ nomad var put secret/creds passcode=my-long-passcode
```

The data can also be consumed from a file on disk by prefixing with the "@"
symbol. For example, you can store a variable using a specification created
with the `nomad var init` command.

```shell-session
$ nomad var put secret/foo @spec.nsv.json
```

Or it can be read from standard input using the "-" symbol:

```shell-session
$ echo "abcd1234" | vault var put secret/foo bar=-
```
