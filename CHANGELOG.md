   that group was done deploying [[GH-4842](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/4842)]
 * driver/raw_exec: Fix issue where tasks that used an interpolated command in driver configuration would not start [[GH-4813](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/pull/4813)]

## 0.8.0 (April 12, 2018)

__BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:__
 * cli: node drain now blocks until the drain completes and all allocations on
   the draining node have stopped. Use -detach for the old behavior.
 * client: Periods (`.`) are no longer replaced with underscores (`_`) in
   environment variables as many applications rely on periods in environment
   variable names. [[GH-3760](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/3760)]
 * client/metrics: The key emitted for tracking a client's uptime has changed
   from "uptime" to "client.uptime". Users monitoring this metric will have to
   switch to the new key name [[GH-4128](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/4128)]
 * discovery: Prevent absolute URLs in check paths. The documentation indicated
   that absolute URLs are not allowed, but it was not enforced. Absolute URLs
   in HTTP check paths will now fail to validate. [[GH-3685](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/3685)]
 * drain: Draining a node no longer stops all allocations immediately: a new
   [migrate stanza](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/migrate.html)
   allows jobs to specify how quickly task groups can be drained. A `-force`
   option can be used to emulate the old drain behavior.
 * jobspec: The default values for restart policy have changed. Restart policy
   mode defaults to "fail" and the attempts/time interval values have been
   changed to enable faster server side rescheduling. See [restart
   stanza](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/restart.html) for
   more information.
 * jobspec: Removed compatibility code that migrated pre Nomad 0.6.0 Update
   stanza syntax. All job spec files should be using update stanza fields
   introduced in 0.7.0

## 0.7.1 (December 19, 2017)

__BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:__
 * client: The format of service IDs in Consul has changed. If you rely upon
   Nomad's service IDs (*not* service names; those are stable), you will need
   to update your code.  [[GH-3632](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/3632)]
 * config: Nomad no longer parses Atlas configuration stanzas. Atlas has been
   deprecated since earlier this year. If you have an Atlas stanza in your
   config file it will have to be removed.
 * config: Default minimum CPU configuration has been changed to 100 from 20. Jobs
   using the old minimum value of 20 will have to be updated.

## 0.3.1 (March 16, 2016)

__BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:__
  * Service names that dont conform to RFC-1123 and RFC-2782 will fail
    validation. To fix, change service name to conform to the RFCs before
    running the job [[GH-915](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/915)]
  * Jobs that downloaded artifacts will have to be updated to the new syntax and
    be resubmitted. The new syntax consolidates artifacts to the `task` rather
    than being duplicated inside each driver config [[GH-921](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/921)]

IMPROVEMENTS:
  * cli: Validate job file schemas [[GH-900](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/900)]

  * driver/rkt: Pass DNS information to rkt driver [[GH-892](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/892)]
  * jobspec: Require RFC-1123 and RFC-2782 valid service names [[GH-915](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/915)]

BUG FIXES:
  * core: No longer cancel evaluations that are delayed in the plan queue
    [[GH-884](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/884)]
  * api: Guard client/fs/ APIs from being accessed on a non-client node [[GH-890](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/890)]

## 0.3.0 (February 25, 2016)

__BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:__
  * Stdout and Stderr log files of tasks have moved from task/local to
    alloc/logs [[GH-851](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/851)]
  * Any users of the runtime environment variable `$NOMAD_PORT_` will need to
    update to the new `${NOMAD_ADDR_}` variable [[GH-704](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/704)]
  * Service names that include periods will fail validation. To fix, remove any
    periods from the service name before running the job [[GH-770](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/770)]
  * Task resources are now validated and enforce minimum resources. If a job
    specifies resources below the minimum they will need to be updated [[GH-739](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/739)]
  * Node ID is no longer specifiable. For users who have set a custom Node
    ID, the node should be drained before Nomad is updated and the data_dir
    should be deleted before starting for the first time [[GH-675](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/675)]
  * Users of custom restart policies should update to the new syntax which adds
    a `mode` field. The `mode` can be either `fail` or `delay`. The default for
    `batch` and `service` jobs is `fail` and `delay` respectively [[GH-594](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/594)]
  * All jobs that interpret variables in constraints or driver configurations
    will need to be updated to the new syntax which wraps the interpreted
    variable in curly braces. (`$node.class` becomes `${node.class}`) [[GH-760](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/760)]

IMPROVEMENTS:
  * core: Populate job status [[GH-663](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/663)]
