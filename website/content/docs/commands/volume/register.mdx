# Command: volume register

The `volume register` command registers external storage volumes with
Nomad's [Container Storage Interface (CSI)][csi] support. The volume
must exist on the remote storage provider before it can be registered
and used by a task.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad volume register [options] [file]
```

The `volume register` command requires a single argument, specifying
the path to a file containing a valid [volume
specification][volume_specification]. This file will be read and the
job will be submitted to Nomad for scheduling. If the supplied path is
"-", the job file is read from STDIN. Otherwise it is read from the
file at the supplied path.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the
`csi-write-volume` capability for the volume's namespace.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Volume Specification

The file may be provided as either HCL or JSON. An example HCL configuration:

```hcl
id = "ebs_prod_db1"
name = "database"
type = "csi"
external_id = "vol-23452345"
plugin_id = "ebs-prod"
access_mode = "single-node-writer"
attachment_mode = "file-system"
mount_options {
   fs_type = "ext4"
   mount_flags = ["ro"]
}
secrets {
   example_secret = "xyzzy"
}
parameters {
    skuname = "Premium_LRS"
}
context {
    endpoint = "http://192.168.1.101:9425"
}
```

## Volume Specification Parameters

- `id` `(string: <required>)` - The unique ID of the volume. This will
  be how [`volume`][csi_volume] stanzas in a jobspec refer to the volume.

- `name` `(string: <required>)` - The display name of the volume.

- `type` `(string: <required>)` - The type of volume. Currently only
  `"csi"` is supported.

- `external_id` `(string: <required>)` - The ID of the physical volume
  from the storage provider. For example, the volume ID of an AWS EBS
  volume or Digital Ocean volume.

- `plugin_id` `(string: <required>)` - The ID of the [CSI
  plugin][csi_plugin] that manages this volume.

- `access_mode` `(string: <required>)` - Defines whether a volume
  should be available concurrently. Can be one of
  `"single-node-reader-only"`, `"single-node-writer"`,
  `"multi-node-reader-only"`, `"multi-node-single-writer"`, or
  `"multi-node-multi-writer"`. Most CSI plugins support only
  single-node modes. Consult the documentation of the storage provider
  and CSI plugin.

- `attachment_mode` `(string: <required>)` - The storage API that will be used
  by the volume. Most storage providers will support `"file-system"`, to mount
  volumes using the CSI filesystem API. Some storage providers will support
  `"block-device"`, which will mount the volume with the CSI block device API
  within the container.

- `mount_options` - Options for mounting `file-system` volumes that don't
  already have a pre-formatted file system. Consult the documentation for your
  storage provider and CSI plugin as to whether these options are required or
  necessary.

  - `fs_type`: file system type (ex. `"ext4"`)
  - `mount_flags`: the flags passed to `mount` (ex. `"ro,noatime"`)

- `secrets` <code>(map<string|string>:nil)</code> - An optional
  key-value map of strings used as credentials for publishing and
  unpublishing volumes.

- `parameters` <code>(map<string|string>:nil)</code> - An optional
  key-value map of strings passed directly to the CSI plugin to
  configure the volume. The details of these parameters are specific
  to each storage provider, so please see the specific plugin
  documentation for more information.

- `context` <code>(map<string|string>:nil)</code> - An optional
  key-value map of strings passed directly to the CSI plugin to
  validate the volume. The details of these parameters are specific to
  each storage provider, so please see the specific plugin
  documentation for more information.
