# `service` Stanza

<Placement
  groups={[
    ['job', 'group', 'service'],
    ['job', 'group', 'task', 'service'],
  ]}
/>

The `service` stanza instructs Nomad to register a service with Consul. This
section of the documentation will discuss the configuration, but please also
read the [Nomad service discovery documentation][service-discovery] for more
detailed information about the integration.

```hcl
job "docs" {
  group "example" {
    task "server" {
      service {
        tags = ["leader", "mysql"]

        port = "db"

        meta {
          meta = "for your service"
        }

        check {
          type     = "tcp"
          port     = "db"
          interval = "10s"
          timeout  = "2s"
        }

        check {
          type     = "script"
          name     = "check_table"
          command  = "/usr/local/bin/check_mysql_table_status"
          args     = ["--verbose"]
          interval = "60s"
          timeout  = "5s"

          check_restart {
            limit = 3
            grace = "90s"
            ignore_warnings = false
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This section of the documentation only cover the job file fields and stanzas
for service discovery. For more details on using Nomad with Consul please see
the [Consul integration documentation][service-discovery].

Nomad 0.10 also allows specifying the `service` stanza at the task group level.
This enables services in the same task group to opt into [Consul
Connect][connect] integration.

## `service` Parameters

- `check` <code>([Check](#check-parameters): nil)</code> - Specifies a health
  check associated with the service. This can be specified multiple times to
  define multiple checks for the service. At this time, Nomad supports the
  `grpc`, `http`, `script`<sup><small>1</small></sup>, and `tcp` checks.

- `connect` - Configures the [Consul Connect][connect] integration. Only
  available on group services.

- `name` `(string: "<job>-<group>-<task>")` - Specifies the name this service
  will be advertised as in Consul. If not supplied, this will default to the
  name of the job, group, and task concatenated together with a dash, like
  `"docs-example-server"`. Each service must have a unique name within the
  cluster. Names must adhere to [RFC-1123
  §2.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123#section-2) and are limited to
  alphanumeric and hyphen characters (i.e. `[a-z0-9\-]`), and be less than 64
  characters in length.

  In addition to the standard [Nomad interpolation][interpolation], the
  following keys are also available:

  - `${JOB}` - the name of the job
  - `${GROUP}` - the name of the group
  - `${TASK}` - the name of the task
  - `${BASE}` - shorthand for `${JOB}-${GROUP}-${TASK}`

  Validation of the name occurs in two parts. When the job is registered, an initial validation pass checks that
  the service name adheres to RFC-1123 §2.1 and the length limit, excluding any variables requiring interpolation.
  Once the client receives the service and all interpretable values are available, the service name will be
  interpolated and revalidated. This can cause certain service names to pass validation at submit time but fail
  at runtime.

- `port` `(string: <optional>)` - Specifies the port to advertise for this
  service. The value of `port` depends on which [`address_mode`](#address_mode)
  is being used:

  - `alloc` - Advertise the mapped `to` value of the labeled port and the allocation address.
    If a `to` value is not set, the port falls back to using the allocated host port. The `port`
    field may be a numeric port or a port label specified in the same group's network stanza.

  - `driver` - Advertise the port determined by the driver (e.g. Docker or rkt).
    The `port` may be a numeric port or a port label specified in the driver's
    `ports` field.

  - `host` - Advertise the host port for this service. `port` must match a port
    _label_ specified in the [`network`][network] stanza.

- `tags` `(array<string>: [])` - Specifies the list of tags to associate with
  this service. If this is not supplied, no tags will be assigned to the service
  when it is registered.

- `canary_tags` `(array<string>: [])` - Specifies the list of tags to associate with
  this service when the service is part of an allocation that is currently a
  canary. Once the canary is promoted, the registered tags will be updated to
  those specified in the `tags` parameter. If this is not supplied, the
  registered tags will be equal to that of the `tags` parameter.

- `enable_tag_override` `(bool: false)` - Enables users of Consul's Catalog API
  to make changes to the tags of a service without having those changes be
  overwritten by Consul's anti-entropy mechanism. See Consul
  [documentation](https://www.consul.io/docs/internals/anti-entropy#enable-tag-override)
  for more information.

- `address_mode` `(string: "auto")` - Specifies which address (host, alloc or
  driver-specific) this service should advertise. This setting is supported in
  Docker since Nomad 0.6 and rkt since Nomad 0.7. See [below for
  examples.](#using-driver-address-mode) Valid options are:

  - `alloc` - For allocations which create a network namespace, this address mode
    uses the IP address inside the namespace. Can only be used with "bridge" and "cni"
    [networking modes][network_mode]. A numeric port may be specified for situations
    where no port mapping is necessary. This mode can only be set for services which
    are defined in a "group" block.

  - `auto` - Allows the driver to determine whether the host or driver address
    should be used. Defaults to `host` and only implemented by Docker. If you
    use a Docker network plugin such as weave, Docker will automatically use
    its address.

  - `driver` - Use the IP specified by the driver, and the port specified in a
    port map. A numeric port may be specified since port maps aren't required
    by all network plugins. Useful for advertising SDN and overlay network
    addresses. Task will fail if driver network cannot be determined. Only
    implemented for Docker and rkt. This mode can only be set for services
    which are defined in a "task" block.

  - `host` - Use the host IP and port.

- `task` `(string: "")` - Specifies the name of the Nomad task associated with
  this service definition. Only available on group services. Must be set if this
  service definition represents a Consul Connect-native service and there is more
  than one task in the task group.

- `meta` <code>([Meta][]: nil)</code> - Specifies a key-value map that annotates
  the Consul service with user-defined metadata.

- `canary_meta` <code>([Meta][]: nil)</code> - Specifies a key-value map that
  annotates the Consul service with user-defined metadata when the service is
  part of an allocation that is currently a canary. Once the canary is
  promoted, the registered meta will be updated to those specified in the
  `meta` parameter. If this is not supplied, the registered meta will be set to
  that of the `meta` parameter.

- `on_update` `(string: "require_healthy")` - Specifies how checks should be
  evaluated when determining deployment health (including a job's initial
  deployment). This allows job submitters to define certain checks as readiness
  checks, progressing a deployment even if the Service's checks are not yet
  healthy. Checks inherit the Service's value by default. The check status is
  not altered in Consul and is only used to determine the check's health during
  an update.

  - `require_healthy` - In order for Nomad to consider the check healthy during
    an update it must report as healthy.

  - `ignore_warnings` - If a Service Check reports as warning, Nomad will treat
    the check as healthy. The Check will still be in a warning state in Consul.

  - `ignore` - Any status will be treated as healthy.

  ~> **Caveat:** `on_update` is only compatible with certain
  [`check_restart`][check_restart_stanza] configurations. `on_update = "ignore_warnings"` requires that `check_restart.ignore_warnings = true`.
  `check_restart` can however specify `ignore_warnings = true` with `on_update = "require_healthy"`. If `on_update` is set to `ignore`, `check_restart` must
  be omitted entirely.

### `check` Parameters

Note that health checks run inside the task. If your task is a Docker container,
the script will run inside the Docker container. If your task is running in a
chroot, it will run in the chroot. Please keep this in mind when authoring check
scripts.

- `address_mode` `(string: "host")` - Same as `address_mode` on `service`.
  Unlike services, checks do not have an `auto` address mode as there's no way
  for Nomad to know which is the best address to use for checks. Consul needs
  access to the address for any HTTP or TCP checks. Added in Nomad 0.7.1. See
  [below for details.](#using-driver-address-mode) Unlike `port`, this setting
  is _not_ inherited from the `service`.

- `args` `(array<string>: [])` - Specifies additional arguments to the
  `command`. This only applies to script-based health checks.

- `check_restart` - See [`check_restart` stanza][check_restart_stanza].

- `command` `(string: <varies>)` - Specifies the command to run for performing
  the health check. The script must exit: 0 for passing, 1 for warning, or any
  other value for a failing health check. This is required for script-based
  health checks.

  ~> **Caveat:** The command must be the path to the command on disk, and no
  shell exists by default. That means operators like `||` or `&&` are not
  available. Additionally, all arguments must be supplied via the `args`
  parameter. To achieve the behavior of shell operators, specify the command
  as a shell, like `/bin/bash` and then use `args` to run the check.

- `grpc_service` `(string: <optional>)` - What service, if any, to specify in
  the gRPC health check. gRPC health checks require Consul 1.0.5 or later.

- `grpc_use_tls` `(bool: false)` - Use TLS to perform a gRPC health check. May
  be used with `tls_skip_verify` to use TLS but skip certificate verification.

- `initial_status` `(string: <enum>)` - Specifies the originating status of the
  service. Valid options are the empty string, `passing`, `warning`, and
  `critical`.

- `success_before_passing` `(int:0)` - The number of consecutive successful checks
  required before Consul will transition the service status to [`passing`][consul_passfail].

- `failures_before_critical` `(int:0)` - The number of consecutive failing checks
  required before Consul will transition the service status to [`critical`][consul_passfail].

- `interval` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the frequency of the health checks
  that Consul will perform. This is specified using a label suffix like "30s"
  or "1h". This must be greater than or equal to "1s".

- `method` `(string: "GET")` - Specifies the HTTP method to use for HTTP
  checks.

- `body` `(string: "")` - Specifies the HTTP body to use for HTTP checks.

- `name` `(string: "service: <name> check")` - Specifies the name of the health
  check. If the name is not specified Nomad generates one based on the service name.
  If you have more than one check you must specify the name.

- `path` `(string: <varies>)` - Specifies the path of the HTTP endpoint which
  Consul will query to query the health of a service. Nomad will automatically
  add the IP of the service and the port, so this is just the relative URL to
  the health check endpoint. This is required for http-based health checks.

- `expose` `(bool: false)` - Specifies whether an [Expose Path](/docs/job-specification/expose#path-parameters)
  should be automatically generated for this check. Only compatible with
  Connect-enabled task-group services using the default Connect proxy. If set, check
  [`type`][type] must be `http` or `grpc`, and check `name` must be set.

- `port` `(string: <varies>)` - Specifies the label of the port on which the
  check will be performed. Note this is the _label_ of the port and not the port
  number unless `address_mode = driver`. The port label must match one defined
  in the [`network`][network] stanza. If a port value was declared on the
  `service`, this will inherit from that value if not supplied. If supplied,
  this value takes precedence over the `service.port` value. This is useful for
  services which operate on multiple ports. `grpc`, `http`, and `tcp` checks
  require a port while `script` checks do not. Checks will use the host IP and
  ports by default. In Nomad 0.7.1 or later numeric ports may be used if
  `address_mode="driver"` is set on the check.

- `protocol` `(string: "http")` - Specifies the protocol for the http-based
  health checks. Valid options are `http` and `https`.

- `task` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the task associated with this
  check. Scripts are executed within the task's environment, and
  `check_restart` stanzas will apply to the specified task. For `checks` on group
  level `services` only. Inherits the [`service.task`][service_task] value if not
  set.

- `timeout` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies how long Consul will wait for a
  health check query to succeed. This is specified using a label suffix like
  "30s" or "1h". This must be greater than or equal to "1s"

  ~> **Caveat:** Script checks use the task driver to execute in the task's
  environment. For task drivers with namespace isolation such as `docker` or
  `exec`, setting up the context for the script check may take an unexpectedly
  long amount of time (a full second or two), especially on busy hosts. The
  timeout configuration must allow for both this setup and the execution of
  the script. Operators should use long timeouts (5 or more seconds) for script
  checks, and monitor telemetry for
  `client.allocrunner.taskrunner.tasklet_timeout`.

- `type` `(string: <required>)` - This indicates the check types supported by
  Nomad. Valid options are `grpc`, `http`, `script`, and `tcp`. gRPC health
  checks require Consul 1.0.5 or later.

- `tls_skip_verify` `(bool: false)` - Skip verifying TLS certificates for HTTPS
  checks. Requires Consul >= 0.7.2.

- `on_update` `(string: "require_healthy")` - Specifies how checks should be
  evaluated when determining deployment health (including a job's initial
  deployment). This allows job submitters to define certain checks as readiness
  checks, progressing a deployment even if the Service's checks are not yet
  healthy. Checks inherit the Service's value by default. The check status is
  not altered in Consul and is only used to determine the check's health during
  an update.

  - `require_healthy` - In order for Nomad to consider the check healthy during
    an update it must report as healthy.

  - `ignore_warnings` - If a Service Check reports as warning, Nomad will treat
    the check as healthy. The Check will still be in a warning state in Consul.

  - `ignore` - Any status will be treated as healthy.

  ~> **Caveat:** `on_update` is only compatible with certain
  [`check_restart`][check_restart_stanza] configurations. `on_update = "ignore_warnings"` requires that `check_restart.ignore_warnings = true`.
  `check_restart` can however specify `ignore_warnings = true` with `on_update = "require_healthy"`. If `on_update` is set to `ignore`, `check_restart` must
  be omitted entirely.

#### `header` Stanza

HTTP checks may include a `header` stanza to set HTTP headers. The `header`
stanza parameters have lists of strings as values. Multiple values will cause
the header to be set multiple times, once for each value.

```hcl
service {
  # ...
  check {
    type     = "http"
    port     = "lb"
    path     = "/_healthz"
    interval = "5s"
    timeout  = "2s"
    header {
      Authorization = ["Basic ZWxhc3RpYzpjaGFuZ2VtZQ=="]
    }
  }
}
```

## `service` Lifecycle

Nomad manages registering, updating, and deregistering services with Consul. It
is important to understand when each of these steps happens and how they can be
customized.

**Registration**: Nomad will register `group` services and checks _before_
starting any tasks. Services and checks for a specific `task` are registered
_after_ the task has started.

**Updating**: If a service or check definition is updated, Nomad will update
the service in Consul as well. Consul is updated without restarting a task.

**Deregistering**: If a running task with a service stanza exits, the services
and checks are immediately deregistered from Consul without delay. If however
Nomad needs to kill a running task, the task is killed in the following order:

1. Immediately remove the services and checks from Consul. This stops new
   traffic from being routed to the task that is being killed.
2. If [`shutdown_delay`][shutdowndelay] is set, wait the configured duration
   before proceeding to step 3. Setting a [`shutdown_delay`][shutdowndelay] can
   be useful if the application itself doesn't handle graceful shutdowns based
   on the [`kill_signal`][killsignal]. The configured delay will provide a
   period of time in which the service is no longer registered in Consul, and
   thus is not receiving additional requests, but hasn't been signalled to
   shutdown. This allows the application time to complete the requests and
   become idle.
3. Send the [`kill_signal`][killsignal] to the task and wait for the task to
   exit. The task should use this time to gracefully drain and finish any
   existing requests.
4. If the task has not exited after the [`kill_timeout`][killtimeout], Nomad
   will force kill the application.

## `service` Examples

The following examples only show the `service` stanzas. Remember that the
`service` stanza is only valid in the placements listed above.

### Basic Service

This example registers a service named "load-balancer" with no health checks.

```hcl
service {
  name = "load-balancer"
  port = "lb"
}
```

This example must be accompanied by a [`network`][network] stanza which defines
a static or dynamic port labeled "lb". For example:

```hcl
network {
  port "lb" {}
}
```

### Script Checks with Shells

This example shows a service with a script check that is evaluated and interpolated in a shell; it
tests whether a file is present at `${HEALTH_CHECK_FILE}` environment variable:

```hcl
service {
  check {
    type    = "script"
    command = "/bin/bash"
    args    = ["-c", "test -f ${HEALTH_CHECK_FILE}"]
  }
}
```

Using `/bin/bash` (or another shell) is required here to interpolate the `${HEALTH_CHECK_FILE}` value.

The following examples of `command` fields **will not work**:

```hcl
# invalid because command is not a path
check {
  type    = "script"
  command = "test -f /tmp/file.txt"
}

# invalid because path will not be interpolated
check {
  type    = "script"
  command = "/bin/test"
  args    = ["-f", "${HEALTH_CHECK_FILE}"]
}
```

### HTTP Health Check

This example shows a service with an HTTP health check. This will query the
service on the IP and port registered with Nomad at `/_healthz` every 5 seconds,
giving the service a maximum of 2 seconds to return a response, and include an
Authorization header. Any non-2xx code is considered a failure.

```hcl
service {
  check {
    type     = "http"
    port     = "lb"
    path     = "/_healthz"
    interval = "5s"
    timeout  = "2s"
    header {
      Authorization = ["Basic ZWxhc3RpYzpjaGFuZ2VtZQ=="]
    }
  }
}
```

### Multiple Health Checks

This example shows a service with multiple health checks defined. All health
checks must be passing in order for the service to register as healthy.

```hcl
service {
  check {
    name     = "HTTP Check"
    type     = "http"
    port     = "lb"
    path     = "/_healthz"
    interval = "5s"
    timeout  = "2s"
  }

  check {
    name     = "HTTPS Check"
    type     = "http"
    protocol = "https"
    port     = "lb"
    path     = "/_healthz"
    interval = "5s"
    timeout  = "2s"
    method   = "POST"
  }

  check {
    name      = "Postgres Check"
    type      = "script"
    command   = "/usr/local/bin/pg-tools"
    args      = ["verify", "database", "prod", "up"]
    interval  = "5s"
    timeout   = "2s"
    on_update = "ignore_warnings"
  }
}
```

### Readiness and Liveness Checks

Multiple checks for a service can be composed to create liveness and readiness
checks by configuring [`on_update`][on_update] for the check.

```hcl
service {
  # This is a liveness check that will be used to verify the service
  # is up and able to serve traffic
  check {
    name     = "tcp_validate"
    type     = "tcp"
    port     = 6379
    interval = "10s"
    timeout  = "2s"
  }

  # This is a readiness check that is used to verify that, for example, the
  # application has elected a leader between allocations. Warnings from
  # this check will be ignored during updates.
  check {
    name      = "leader-check"
    type      = "script"
    command   = "/bin/bash"
    interval  = "30s"
    timeout   = "10s"
    task      = "server"
    on_update = "ignore_warnings"

    args = [
      "-c",
      "echo 'service is not the leader'; exit 1;",
    ]
  }
}
```

### gRPC Health Check

gRPC health checks use the same host and port behavior as `http` and `tcp`
checks, but gRPC checks also have an optional gRPC service to health check. Not
all gRPC applications require a service to health check. gRPC health checks
require Consul 1.0.5 or later.

```hcl
service {
  check {
    type            = "grpc"
    port            = "rpc"
    interval        = "5s"
    timeout         = "2s"
    grpc_service    = "example.Service"
    grpc_use_tls    = true
    tls_skip_verify = true
  }
}
```

In this example Consul would health check the `example.Service` service on the
`rpc` port defined in the task's [network resources][network] stanza. See
[Using Driver Address Mode](#using-driver-address-mode) for details on address
selection.

### Using Driver Address Mode

The [Docker](/docs/drivers/docker#network_mode) and
[rkt](/docs/drivers/rkt#net) drivers support the `driver` setting for the
`address_mode` parameter in both `service` and `check` stanzas. The driver
address mode allows advertising and health checking the IP and port assigned to
a task by the driver. This way, if you're using a network plugin like Weave with
Docker, you can advertise the Weave address in Consul instead of the host's
address.

For example if you were running the example Redis job in an environment with
Weave but Consul was running on the host you could use the following
configuration:

```hcl
job "example" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]

  network {
    port "db" {
      to = 6379
    }
  }

  group "cache" {

    task "redis" {
      driver = "docker"

      config {
        image = "redis:3.2"
        network_mode = "weave"
        ports = ["db"]
      }

      resources {
        cpu    = 500 # 500 MHz
        memory = 256 # 256MB
      }

      service {
        name = "weave-redis"
        port = "db"
        check {
          name     = "host-redis-check"
          type     = "tcp"
          interval = "10s"
          timeout  = "2s"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

No explicit `address_mode` required.

Services default to the `auto` address mode. When a Docker network mode other
than "host" or "bridge" is used, services will automatically advertise the
driver's address (in this case Weave's). The service will advertise the
container's port: 6379.

However since Consul is often run on the host without access to the Weave
network, `check` stanzas default to `host` address mode. The TCP check will run
against the host's IP and the dynamic host port assigned by Nomad.

Note that the `check` still inherits the `service` stanza's `db` port label,
but each will resolve the port label according to their address mode.

If Consul has access to the Weave network the job could be configured like
this:

```hcl
job "example" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
  group "cache" {

    task "redis" {
      driver = "docker"

      config {
        image = "redis:3.2"
        network_mode = "weave"
        # No port map required.
      }

      resources {
        cpu    = 500 # 500 MHz
        memory = 256 # 256MB
      }

      service {
        name = "weave-redis"
        port = 6379
        address_mode = "driver"
        check {
          name     = "host-redis-check"
          type     = "tcp"
          interval = "10s"
          timeout  = "2s"
          port     = 6379

          address_mode = "driver"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this case Nomad doesn't need to assign Redis any host ports. The `service`
and `check` stanzas can both specify the port number to advertise and check
directly since Nomad isn't managing any port assignments.

### IPv6 Docker containers

The [Docker](/docs/drivers/docker#advertise_ipv6_address) driver supports the
`advertise_ipv6_address` parameter in its configuration.

Services will automatically advertise the IPv6 address when `advertise_ipv6_address`
is used.

Unlike services, checks do not have an `auto` address mode as there's no way
for Nomad to know which is the best address to use for checks. Consul needs
access to the address for any HTTP or TCP checks.

So you have to set `address_mode` parameter in the `check` stanza to `driver`.

For example using `auto` address mode:

```hcl
job "example" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
  group "cache" {

    network {
      port "db" {
        to = 6379
      }
    }


    task "redis" {
      driver = "docker"

      config {
        image = "redis:3.2"
        advertise_ipv6_address = true
        ports = ["db"]
      }

      resources {
        cpu    = 500 # 500 MHz
        memory = 256 # 256MB
      }

      service {
        name = "ipv6-redis"
        port = "db"
        check {
          name     = "ipv6-redis-check"
          type     = "tcp"
          interval = "10s"
          timeout  = "2s"
          port     = "db"
          address_mode = "driver"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or using `address_mode=driver` for `service` and `check` with numeric ports:

```hcl
job "example" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
  group "cache" {

    task "redis" {
      driver = "docker"

      config {
        image = "redis:3.2"
        advertise_ipv6_address = true
        # No port map required.
      }

      resources {
        cpu    = 500 # 500 MHz
        memory = 256 # 256MB
      }

      service {
        name = "ipv6-redis"
        port = 6379
        address_mode = "driver"
        check {
          name     = "ipv6-redis-check"
          type     = "tcp"
          interval = "10s"
          timeout  = "2s"
          port     = 6379
          address_mode = "driver"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `service` and `check` stanzas can both specify the port number to
advertise and check directly since Nomad isn't managing any port assignments.

  Script checks are not supported for the QEMU driver since the Nomad client
  does not have access to the file system of a task for that driver.
