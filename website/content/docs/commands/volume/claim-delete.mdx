# Command: volume claim delete

The `volume claim delete` deletes a task group host volume claim. These claims
are used by [stateful deployments].

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad volume claim delete [options] [claim_id]
```

This command accepts claim ID or prefix as the sole argument. If there is an
exact match based on the provided claim ID or prefix, it is deleted.  Otherwise,
a list of matching claims and information will be displayed.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the `host-volume-write`
capability in the volume's namespace.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Delete Options

- `-y`: Automatically answers "yes" to all the questions, making the deletion
  non-interactive. Defaults to "false."

## Example

List of all volumes:

```shell-session
$ nomad volume claim delete 3f25be9a

  If you delete a volume claim, the allocation that uses this claim to "stick"
  to a particular volume ID will no longer use it upon its next reschedule or
  migration. The deployment of the task group the allocation runs will still
  claim another feasible volume ID during reschedule or replacement.
