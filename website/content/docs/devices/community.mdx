# Community Supported

If you have authored a device plugin that you believe will be useful to the
broader Nomad community and you are committed to maintaining the plugin, please
file a PR to add your plugin to this page.

## Authoring Device Plugins

Nomad has a plugin system for defining device drivers. External device plugins
will have the same user experience as built in drivers. For details on
authoring a device plugin, please refer to the [plugin authoring
guide][plugin_guide].
