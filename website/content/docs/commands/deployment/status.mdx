# Command: deployment status

The `deployment status` command is used to display the status of a deployment.
The status will display the number of desired changes as well as the currently
applied changes.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad deployment status [options] <deployment id>
```

The `deployment status` command requires a single argument, a deployment ID or
prefix.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the 'read-job'
capability for the deployment's namespace.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Status Options

- `-json` : Output the deployment in its JSON format.
- `-t` : Format and display the deployment using a Go template.
- `-verbose`: Show full information.

## Examples

Inspect the status of a complete deployment:

```shell-session
$ nomad deployment status 06ca68a2
ID          = 06ca68a2
Job ID      = example
Job Version = 0
Status      = successful
Description = Deployment completed successfully

Deployed
Task Group  Desired  Placed  Healthy  Unhealthy
cache       2        2       2        0
web         2        2       2        0
```

Inspect the status of a deployment that is waiting for canary promotion:

```shell-session
$ nomad deployment status 0b
ID          = 0b23b149
Job ID      = example
Job Version = 1
Status      = running
Description = Deployment is running but requires manual promotion

Deployed
Task Group  Promoted  Desired  Canaries  Placed  Healthy  Unhealthy
cache       false     2        1         1       0        0
web         N/A       2        0         2       2        0
```
