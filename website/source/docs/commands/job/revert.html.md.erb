# Command: job revert

The `job revert` command is used to revert a job to a prior version of the
job. The available versions to revert to can be found using [`job
history`](/docs/commands/job/history.html) command.

## Usage

```
nomad job revert [options] <job> <version>
```

The `job revert` command requires two inputs, the job ID and the version of that job
to revert to.

## General Options

<%= partial "docs/commands/_general_options" %>

## Revert Options

* `-detach`: Return immediately instead of monitoring. A new evaluation ID
  will be output, which can be used to examine the evaluation using the
  [eval-status](/docs/commands/eval-status.html) command

* `-verbose`: Show full information.

## Examples

Revert to an older version of a job:

```
$ nomad job history -p example
Version     = 1
Stable      = false
Submit Date = 07/25/17 21:27:30 UTC
Diff        =
+/- Job: "example"
+/- Task Group: "cache"
  +/- Task: "redis"
    +/- Config {
      +/- image:           "redis:3.2" => "redis:4.0"
          port_map[0][db]: "6379"
        }

Version     = 0
Stable      = false
Submit Date = 07/25/17 21:27:18 UTC

$ nomad job revert example 0
