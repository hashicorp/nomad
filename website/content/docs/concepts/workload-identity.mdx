# Workload Identity

Every workload running in Nomad is given an identity. When an [allocation][] is
accepted by the [plan applier][], the leader generates a Workload Identity for
each task in the allocation. This workload identity is a [JSON Web Token
(JWT)][] that has been signed by the leader's keyring. The workload identity
includes the following identity claims:

```json
{
  "nomad_namespace": "default",
  "nomad_job_id": "example",
  "nomad_allocation_id": "5c6328f7-48c5-4d03-bada-91ef2e904d0d",
  "nomad_task": "web"
}
```

# Using Workload Identity

While Nomad always creates and uses workload identities internally, the JWT is
not exposed to tasks by default.

# Workload Associated ACL Policies

You can associate additional ACL policies with workload identities by passing
the `-job`, `-group`, and `-task` flags to `nomad acl policy apply`. When Nomad
resolves a workload identity claim, it will automatically include policies that
match. If no matching policies exist, the workload identity does not have any
additional capabilities.

For example, to allow a workload access to secrets from the namespace "shared",
you can create the following policy file:

```hcl
namespace "shared" {
  variables {
    path "*" {
      capabilities = ["read"]
    }
  }
}
```

You can then apply this policy to a specific task:

```shell-session
nomad acl policy apply \
   -namespace default -job example -group cache -task redis \
   redis-policy ./policy.hcl
```

You can also apply this policy to all tasks in the group by omitting the `-task`
flag:

```shell-session
nomad acl policy apply \
   -namespace default -job example -group cache \
   redis-policy ./policy.hcl
```

And you can apply this policy to all groups in the job by omitting both the
`-group` and `-task` flag:

```shell-session
nomad acl policy apply \
   -namespace default -job example \
   redis-policy ./policy.hcl
```

## Using Workload Identity

In Nomad 1.4.0 the workload identity is used only for `template`
access to [Variables][] and not exposed outside of Nomad.
