# Nomad version-specific upgrade guides

The [upgrading page](/nomad/docs/upgrade) covers the details of doing a standard
upgrade. However, specific versions of Nomad may have more details provided for
their upgrades as a result of new features or changed behavior. This page is
used to document those details separately from the standard upgrade flow.

## Nomad 1.11.0

#### Sysbatch jobs will no longer accept `reschedule` blocks

In Nomad 1.11.0, submitting a sysbatch job with a `reschedule` block returns
an error instead of being silently ignored, as it was in previous versions. The
same behavior applies to system jobs.

#### Eval broker metrics for dispatch and periodic jobs

The leader records metrics for the eval broker. In Nomad 1.11.0 the `job` label
on the `nomad.nomad.broker.wait_time`, `nomad.nomad.broker.process_time`,
`nomad.nomad.broker.response_time`, and `nomad.nomad.broker.eval_waiting`
metrics refers to the parent job ID for dispatch and periodic jobs. The
`nomad.nomad.broker.eval_waiting` no longer has an `eval_id` label. For clusters
running high volume dispatch workloads, this change significantly reduces
metrics cardinality and memory usage on the leader.

#### ACL policies no longer silently ignore duplicate or invalid keys

Nomad 1.11.0 introduces stricter validation for ACL policies. Policy writes that
include duplicate or invalid keys will be rejected with an error instead of
being silently ignored. Any existing policies with duplicate or invalid keys
will continue to work, but the source policy document will need to be updated
to be valid before it can be written to Nomad.

#### Maximum number of allocations per job is limited by default

Nomad 1.11.0 limits the maximum number of allocations for a job to the value of
the new [`job_max_count`](/nomad/docs/configuration/server#job_max_count) server
configuration option, which defaults to 50000. The number of allocations is
determined from the sum of the job's task group `count` fields. This limit is
enforced at the time the job is submitted or scaled, and updating the value will
not impact existing jobs.

#### Deprecated resource fields on Node API

The `Resources` and `Reserved` fields on the Go API's `Node` struct, as well as
the equivalent fileds on the [Read Node](/nomad/api-docs/nodes#read-node) API,
are deprecated. These fields are never populated. Use the `NodeResources` and
`ReservedResources` fields instead.

#### Enterprise product usage reporting <EnterpriseAlert inline />

Nomad Enterprise 1.11.0 adds detailed product usage information to
[automated license utilization reporting](/nomad/docs/enterprise/license/utilization-reporting).

## Nomad 1.10.6

#### ACL policies no longer silently ignore duplicate or invalid keys

Nomad 1.10.6 introduces stricter validation for ACL policies. Policy writes that
include duplicate or invalid keys will be rejected with an error instead of
being silently ignored. Any existing policies with duplicate or invalid keys
will continue to work, but the source policy document will need to be updated
to be valid before it can be written to Nomad.

#### Enterprise product usage reporting <EnterpriseAlert inline />

Nomad Enterprise 1.10.6 adds detailed product usage information to
[automated license utilization reporting](/nomad/docs/enterprise/license/utilization-reporting).

## Nomad 1.10.2

#### Clients respect `telemetry.publish_allocation_metrics`

Nomad 1.10.2 fixed a bug where allocation metrics were collected and published
even if the
[`telemetry.publish_allocation_metrics`](/nomad/docs/configuration/telemetry#publish_allocation_metrics)
configuration field was unset or set to `false`. If you are monitoring
allocation metrics, you will need to ensure your Nomad clients set this field to
`true`.

## Nomad 1.10.1

@include 'release-notes/v1-10-1/breaking-raft-peer.mdx'

@include 'release-notes/v1-10-1/breaking-agent-exit.mdx'

#### Added Server `start_timeout` Configuration Option

Nomad 1.10.1 introduces a new server configuration option named `start_timeout`
with a default value of `30s`. This duration is used to monitor the server setup
and startup processes which must complete before it is considered healthy, such
as keyring decryption. If these processes do not complete before the timeout is
reached, the server process will exit and any errors logged to the console.

#### Corrected `/v1/acl/token/self` response codes

Nomad 1.10.1 responds with different HTTP response codes to API calls sent to
`/v1/acl/token/self`. For users that do not have ACLs enabled, the endpoint
responds with 200 code and a response body that indicates that ACLs are
disabled. Previously, the response code in such a scenario was 404.

For users that do have ACLs enabled and do not have a valid ACL token present,
the endpoint responds with 403 code. Previously, the response code in such a
scenario was 404.

## Nomad 1.10.0

@include 'release-notes/v1-10/deprecate-variable-limits.mdx'

@include 'release-notes/v1-10/breaking-disconnect-fields-removed.mdx'

@include 'release-notes/v1-10/breaking-go-sdk.mdx'

@include 'release-notes/v1-10/breaking-affinity-spread.mdx'

@include 'release-notes/v1-10/breaking-vault-consul-token.mdx'

## Nomad 1.9.9

#### Added Server `start_timeout` Configuration Option

Nomad 1.9.9 introduces a new server configuration option named `start_timeout`
with a default value of `30s`. This duration is used to monitor the server setup
and startup processes which must complete before it is considered healthy, such
as keyring decryption. If these processes do not complete before the timeout is
reached, the server process will exit and any errors logged to the console.

## Nomad 1.9.5

#### CNI plugins

Nomad 1.9.5 includes a bug fix for restoring allocation networking after a
client host reboot. This fix requires recent versions of the CNI reference
plugins (minimum 1.2.0) and will fallback to the existing behavior if the CNI
reference plugins cannot support the fix.

We recommend installing the CNI reference plugins from the [CNI project release
page](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases) rather than your
Linux distribution's package manager.

## Nomad 1.9.4

#### Security updates to default deny lists

In Nomad 1.9.4, the default `function_denylist` includes `executeTemplate`, as
a measure to prevent accidental or malicious infinitely recursive execution.
Users that require `executeTemplate` should update their
[configuration](/nomad/docs/v1.9.x/job-specification/template#function_denylist).

Additionally, the [default client env deny
list](/nomad/docs/v1.9.x/configuration/client#env-denylist) includes more environment
variables. Users who need some of these secure environment variables passed to
their tasks should consult the list and overwrite it in the configuration.

## Nomad 1.9.3

In Nomad 1.9.3, the mechanism used for calculating when objects are eligible
for garbage collection changes to a clock-based one. This has two consequences.
First, it allows to set arbitrarily long GC intervals. Second, it requires that
Nomad servers are kept roughly in sync time-wise, because GC can originate in a
follower.

Nomad 1.9.2 contained a bug that could drop all cluster state on upgrade and
has been removed from downloads.

## Nomad 1.9.0

#### Dropped support for older clients

Nomad 1.9.0 removes support for Nomad client agents older than 1.6.0. Older
nodes fail heartbeats. Nomad servers mark the workloads on those nodes
as lost and reschedule them normally according to the job's [reschedule][]
block.

#### Keyring In Raft

Nomad 1.9.0 stores keys used for signing Workload Identity and encrypting
Variables in Raft, instead of storing key material in the external
keystore. When using external KMS or Vault transit encryption for the
[`keyring`](/nomad/docs/v1.9.x/configuration/keyring) provider, the key encryption key
(KEK) is stored outside of Nomad and no cleartext key material exists on disk.
When using the default AEAD provider, the key encryption key (KEK) is stored in
Raft alongside the encrypted data encryption keys (DEK).

Nomad automatically migrates the key storage for all key material on the
first [`root_key_gc_interval`](/nomad/docs/v1.9.x/configuration/server#root_key_gc_interval) after all servers are upgraded to 1.9.0. The
existing on-disk keystore is required to restore servers from older snapshots,
so you should continue to back up the on-disk keystore until you no longer need
those older snapshots.

#### Support for HCLv1 removed

Nomad 1.9.0 no longer supports the HCLv1 format for job specifications. Using
the `-hcl1` option for the `job run`, `job plan`, and `job validate` commands
will no longer work.

One common use of `-hcl1` was when specifying [Docker
labels](/nomad/docs/v1.9.x/drivers/docker#labels) with dots in their keys such as for
DataDog autodiscovery:

```hcl
labels {
  "com.datadoghq.ad.check_names"  = "[\"openmetrics\"]"
  "com.datadoghq.ad.init_configs" = "[{}]"
  # ...
}
```

Quoted keys are invalid in HCLv2 blocks and must be specified with a
list-of-maps syntax:

```hcl
labels = [
  {
    "com.datadoghq.ad.check_names"  = "[\"openmetrics\"]"
    "com.datadoghq.ad.init_configs" = "[{}]"
    # ...
  }
]
```

## Nomad 1.8.18

#### ACL policies no longer silently ignore duplicate or invalid keys

Nomad 1.8.18 introduces stricter validation for ACL policies. Policy writes that
include duplicate or invalid keys will be rejected with an error instead of
being silently ignored. Any existing policies with duplicate or invalid keys
will continue to work, but the source policy document will need to be updated
to be valid before it can be written to Nomad.

#### Enterprise product usage reporting <EnterpriseAlert inline />

Nomad Enterprise 1.8.18 adds detailed product usage information to
[automated license utilization reporting](/nomad/docs/enterprise/license/utilization-reporting).

## Nomad 1.8.4

#### Default Docker `infra_image` changed

Due to the deprecation of the third-party `gcr.io` registry, the default Docker
[`infra_image`](/nomad/docs/v1.8.x/drivers/docker#infra_image) is now `registry.k8s.io/pause-<arch>:3.3`. If you do not
override the default, clients using the `docker` driver will make outbound
requests to the new registry.

## Nomad 1.8.3

#### Nomad keyring rotation

In Nomad 1.8.3, the Nomad root keyring will prepublish keys at half the
`root_key_rotation_threshold` and promote them to active once the
`root_key_rotation_threshold` has passed. The `nomad operator root keyring
rotate` command now requires one of two arguments: `-prepublish <duration>` to
prepublish a key or `-now` to rotate immediately. We recommend using
`-prepublish` to avoid outages from workload identities used to log into
external services such as Vault or Consul.

## Nomad 1.8.2

#### New `windows_allow_insecure_container_admin` configuration option for Docker driver

In 1.8.2, Nomad will refuse to run jobs that use the Docker driver on Windows
with [Process
Isolation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-containers/hyperv-container#process-isolation)
that run as `ContainerAdmin`. This is in order to
provide a more secure environment for these jobs, and this behavior can be
overridden by setting the new `windows_allow_insecure_container_admin` Docker
plugin configuration option to `true` or by setting `privileged=true`. We made
this change as a result of regressions introduced by mitigations for
[HCSEC-2024-03](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2024-03-nomad-vulnerable-to-arbitrary-write-through-symlink-attack/62602).

#### New default isolation mode for Docker on Windows

Nomad 1.8.2 changes the default isolation mode for Docker tasks on Windows from
`process` to `hyperv`, since `hyperv` provides a much more secure execution
environment. We made this change as a result of regressions introduced by
mitigations for
[HCSEC-2024-03](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2024-03-nomad-vulnerable-to-arbitrary-write-through-symlink-attack/62602).

## Nomad 1.8.1

<EnterpriseAlert inline />

Nomad Enterprise 1.8.1 includes an updated version of the Sentinel library. Users
that have built custom Sentinel plugins must recompile them using an SDK
supporting Sentinel Plugin Protocol Version 3. Consult the Sentinel
[SDK Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/hashicorp/sentinel-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#sdk-compatibility-matrix) for appropriate Sentinel SDK versions.

## Nomad 1.8.0

#### Deprecated Disconnect Fields

Nomad 1.8.0 introduces a `disconnect` block meant to group all the configuration
options related to disconnected client's and server's behavior, causing the
deprecation of the fields `stop_after_client_disconnect`, `max_client_disconnect`
and `prevent_reschedule_on_lost`. This block also introduces new options for
allocations reconciliation if the client regains connectivity.

#### CNI Constraints

In Nomad 1.8.0, jobs with `bridge` networking will have constraints added during
job submit that require CNI plugins to be present on the node. Nodes have
fingerprinted the available CNI plugins starting in Nomad 1.5.0.

If you are upgrading from Nomad 1.5.0 or later to 1.8.0 or later, there's
nothing additional for you to do. It's not recommended to skip more than 2
versions of Nomad. But if you upgrade from earlier than 1.5.0 to 1.8.0 or later,
you will need to ensure that clients have been upgraded before submitting any
jobs that use `bridge` networking.

#### Removal of `raw_exec` option `no_cgroups`

In Nomad 1.7.0 the `raw_exec` plugin option for `no_cgroups` became ineffective.
Starting in Nomad 1.8.0 attempting to set the `no_cgroups` in `raw_exec` plugin
configuration will result in an error when starting the agent.

## Nomad 1.7.11

<EnterpriseAlert inline />

#### Nomad keyring rotation

In Nomad 1.7.11, the Nomad root keyring will prepublish keys at half the
`root_key_rotation_threshold` and promote them to active once the
`root_key_rotation_threshold` has passed. The `nomad operator root keyring
rotate` command now requires one of two arguments: `-prepublish <duration>` to
prepublish a key or `-now` to rotate immediately. We recommend using
`-prepublish` to avoid outages from workload identities used to log into
external services such as Vault or Consul.

## Nomad 1.7.10

<EnterpriseAlert inline />

#### New `windows_allow_insecure_container_admin` configuration option for Docker driver

In 1.7.10, Nomad will refuse to run jobs that use the Docker driver on Windows
with [Process
Isolation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-containers/hyperv-container#process-isolation)
that run as `ContainerAdmin`. This is in order to
provide a more secure environment for these jobs, and this behavior can be
overridden by setting the new `windows_allow_insecure_container_admin` Docker
plugin configuration option to `true` or by setting `privileged=true`.

#### New default isolation mode for Docker on Windows

Nomad 1.7.10 changes the default isolation mode for Docker tasks on Windows from
`process` to `hyperv`, since `hyperv` provides a much more secure execution
environment.

## Nomad 1.7.2

Nomad 1.7.2 fixes a critical bug in CPU fingerprinting in Nomad 1.7.0 and
1.7.1. You should not install Nomad 1.7.0 or 1.7.1 and instead install the
latest Nomad 1.7.x version.

## Nomad 1.7.0

<Warning>

Nomad 1.7.0 contains a critical bug in keyring replication. You should not
install Nomad 1.7.0 and instead install the latest Nomad 1.7.x version.

</Warning>

#### Keyring Replication Failure After Leader Election

Nomad 1.7.0 introduced new RSA keys to the keyring for use in signing workload
identities. These keys were not correctly replicated from leader to
followers. This results in all workload identity verification failing after a
leader election.

This bug was fixed in Nomad 1.7.1.

#### Vault Integration Changes

Starting in Nomad 1.7, Nomad clients will use a task's [Workload Identity][] to
authenticate to Vault and obtain a Vault token specific to the task.

The existing workflow using a Vault token provided in either the agent
configuration or at the time of job submission is deprecated and will be removed
in Nomad 1.10. The [`vault.policies`](/nomad/docs/v1.7.x/job-specification/vault#policies) field is also deprecated and will work
only with the existing workflow. Instead, you should configure a suitable Vault
role and use that.

The following agent configuration fields are deprecated:
- [`vault.allow_unauthenticated`](/nomad/docs/v1.7.x/configuration/vault#allow_unauthenticated) will be removed in Nomad 1.10. Tasks will use
  the workload identity without the user supplying a Vault token.
- [`vault.task_token_ttl`](/nomad/docs/v1.7.x/configuration/vault#task_token_ttl) will be removed in Nomad 1.10. With workload
  identity, tasks will receive their TTL configuration from the Vault role.
- [`vault.token`](/nomad/docs/v1.7.x/configuration/vault#token) will be removed in Nomad 1.10. Nomad agents will no longer
  make requests to authenticated endpoints except with a task's workload
  identity.

Before upgrading to Nomad 1.10 you will need to have configured authentication
with Vault to work with workload identity. Refer to [Migrating to Using Workload
Identity with Vault](/nomad/docs/v1.7.x/integrations/vault/acl#migrating-to-using-workload-identity-with-vault) for more details.

#### Consul Integration Changes

Starting in Nomad 1.7, Nomad clients will use a service's or task's [Workload
Identity](/nomad/docs/v1.7.x/concepts/workload-identity) to authenticate to Consul and obtain a Consul token specific to the
workload.

The existing workflow using a Consul token provided in either the agent
configuration or at the time of job submission is deprecated and will be removed
in Nomad 1.10. The [`consul.allow_unauthenticated`](/nomad/docs/v1.7.x/configuration/consul#allow_unauthenticated) agent configuration field
will be removed in Nomad 1.10. Tasks will use the workload identity without the
user supplying a Consul token.

Before upgrading to Nomad 1.10 you will need to have configured authentication
with Consul to work with workload identity. See [Migrating to Using Workload
Identity with
Consul](/nomad/docs/v1.7.x/integrations/consul/acl#migrating-to-using-workload-identity-with-consul)
for more details.

#### RS256 JWT Signing Algorithm Support

Prior to Nomad 1.7, workload identity JWTs were signed with the `EdDSA`
algorithm. While `EdDSA` has numerous advantages as a signing algorithm, most
third parties that accept JWTs expect the `RS256` signing algorithm to be used.

Therefore starting in Nomad 1.7 *new* signing keys will generate an RSA key and
sign workload identities with the `RS256` signing algorithm.

Before setting up third party authentication methods to use workload
identities, it is recommended to run [`nomad operator root keyring
rotate`](/nomad/commands/operator/root/keyring-rotate) to ensure you
generate a new RSA key.

To verify an RSA key is present you may check the [`/.well-known/jwks.json`
endpoint](/nomad/api-docs/operator/keyring#list-active-public-keys) on any
Nomad agent. If you see `"kty": "RSA"`, then an RSA key exists and you do not
need to rotate keys.

New Nomad clusters will use RSA by default and are not affected.

#### CPU Fingerprinting Changes

Starting in Nomad 1.7, Nomad clients improve the accuracy of detected CPU
performance metrics. The fingerprinter now takes into account heterogeneous core
types on applicable processors. In addition, Nomad will attempt to detect and
use the base frequency of the processor rather than the turbo frequency when
calculating the total available CPU bandwidth. The net result of these behaviors
is that the calculated total CPU bandwidth available on a node may change when
upgrading to Nomad 1.7. Operators are encouraged to ensure planned capacity
meets expectations before upgrading. The [cpu concepts][cpu] documentation
contains guidance in understanding how Nomad detects CPU metrics.

#### CPU EC2 Detection Changes

Prior to Nomad 1.7, Nomad clients embedded a large lookup table of CPU
performance data for every EC2 instance type. In 1.7 and later Nomad instead
gathers this data by executing the `dmidecode` command. The `dmidecode` package
must be installed manually on some Linux distributions before the Nomad agent
is started.

#### CPU Core Isolation

Starting in Nomad 1.7, Nomad tasks that specify CPU resources using the `cores`
attribute will be restricted to using only the CPU cores assigned to them. In
previous versions of Nomad these tasks could also make use of other non-reserved
CPU cores. However this feature would cause severe performance problems for
the Linux kernel as the number of tasks increased. Operators are encouraged
to ensure tasks making use of the `cores` attribute are given sufficient CPU
resources before upgrading.

#### The `distinct_hosts` Constraint Now Honors Namespaces

Nomad 1.7.0 changes the behavior of the [`distinct_hosts`](/nomad/docs/v1.7.x/job-specification/constraint#distinct_hosts) constraint such that
namespaces are taken into account when choosing feasible clients for allocation
placement. The previous, less-expected behavior would cause **any** job with the
same name running on a client to cause that node to be considered infeasible.

This change allows workloads that formerly did not colocate to be scheduled
onto the same client when they are in different namespaces. To prevent this,
consider using [node pools] and constrain the jobs with a [`distinct_property`](/nomad/docs/v1.7.x/job-specification/constraint#distinct_property)
constraint over [`${node.pool}`](/nomad/docs/v1.7.x/runtime/interpolation#node-attributes).

#### Loading Binaries from `plugin_dir` Without Configuration

Starting with Nomad 1.7.0, loading plugins that are not referenced in the agent
configuration file is deprecated. Future versions of Nomad will only load
plugins that have a corresponding [`plugin`](/nomad/docs/v1.7.x/configuration/plugin)
block in the agent configuration file.

#### Changes to `raw_exec`

The `raw_exec` task driver now enforces memory limits via cgroups on Linux
platforms similar to the `exec` and `docker` task drivers. The driver does
support memory [oversubscription](/nomad/docs/v1.7.x/job-specification/resources#memory-oversubscription), which can be configured in such a
way to nearly replicate the previously unlimited behavior.

The `no_cgroups` configuration option no longer has any effect. Previously,
setting `no_cgroups` would disable the mechanism where Nomad used the freezer
cgroup to halt the process group of a Task before issuing a kill signal to each
process. Starting in Nomad 1.7.0 this behavior is always enabled (and a similar
mechanism has always been enabled on cgroups v2 systems).

## Nomad 1.6.14

<EnterpriseAlert inline />

#### Nomad keyring rotation

In Nomad 1.6.14, the Nomad root keyring will prepublish keys at half the
`root_key_rotation_threshold` and promote them to active once the
`root_key_rotation_threshold` has passed. The `nomad operator root keyring
rotate` command now requires one of two arguments: `-prepublish <duration>` to
prepublish a key or `-now` to rotate immediately. We recommend using
`-prepublish` to avoid outages from workload identities used to log into
external services such as Vault or Consul.

## Nomad 1.6.13

<EnterpriseAlert inline />

#### New `windows_allow_insecure_container_admin` configuration option for Docker driver

In 1.6.13, Nomad will refuse to run jobs that use the Docker driver on Windows
with [Process
Isolation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-containers/hyperv-container#process-isolation)
that run as `ContainerAdmin`. This is in order to
provide a more secure environment for these jobs, and this behavior can be
overridden by setting the new `windows_allow_insecure_container_admin` Docker
plugin configuration option to `true` or by setting `privileged=true`.

#### New default isolation mode for Docker on Windows

Nomad 1.6.13 changes the default isolation mode for Docker tasks on Windows from
`process` to `hyperv`, since `hyperv` provides a much more secure execution
environment.

## Nomad 1.6.0

#### Enterprise License Validation with BuildDate

Nomad Enterprise 1.6.0 now compares license `ExpirationTime` with the Nomad binary's `BuildDate`,
rather than comparing the sometimes more lenient license `TerminationTime` with `time.Now()`.
See the [licensing FAQ](/nomad/docs/v1.6.x/enterprise/license/faq) for more info,
but most relevant here is that you should run the new
[`nomad license inspect`](/nomad/docs/v1.6.x/commands/license/inspect) command
before trying to upgrade your Enterprise servers to v1.6.0 or higher.

#### Job Evaluate API Endpoint Requires `submit-job` Instead of `read-job`

Nomad 1.6.0 updated the ACL capability requirement for the job evaluate
endpoint from `read-job` to `submit-job` to better reflect that this operation
writes state to Nomad. This endpoint is used by the `nomad job eval` CLI
command and so the ACL requirements changed for the command as well. Users that
called this endpoint or used this command using tokens with just the `read-job`
capability or the `read` policy must update their tokens to use the
`submit-job` capability or the `write` policy.

#### Exec Driver Requires New Capability for mlock

Nomad 1.6.0 updated the `exec` task driver to maintain the max memory locked
limit set by the host system. In earlier versions of Nomad this limit was
*unset* unintentionally.

In practice this means that `exec` tasks such as Vault which use the `mlock`
system call will now need to explicitly add the `ipc_lock` capability.

First [allow the `ipc_lock` capability in the Client
configuration](/nomad/docs/v1.6.x/drivers/exec#allow_caps):

```hcl
plugin "exec" {
  config {
    allow_caps = ["audit_write", "chown", "dac_override", "fowner", "fsetid",
      "kill", "mknod", "net_bind_service", "setfcap", "setgid", "setpcap",
      "setuid", "sys_chroot", "ipc_lock"]
  }
}
```

Then [add the `ipc_lock` capability to the exec task](/nomad/docs/v1.6.x/drivers/exec#cap_add) that uses
`mlock`:

```hcl
task "vault" {
  driver = "exec"

  config {
    cap_add = ["ipc_lock"]

    # ... other task configuration
  }

# ... rest of jobspec
```

These additions are backward compatible with Nomad v1.5, so Clients and Jobs
should be updated prior to upgrading to Nomad v1.6.

See [#17780](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/17780) for details.

#### Namespace ACL policies require a label

Nomad 1.6.0 does not allow ACL policies for namespaces without a label. Prior
to this version, ACL policies for namespaces were allowed to be defined
without a label, and the documented behavior in this case was that the policy
would be applied to the `default` namespace.

A bug in this logic caused the policy to be incorrectly applied to a different
namespace. For example, the policy below would be applied to a namespace called
`policy` instead of `default`.

```hcl
namespace {
  policy = "read"
}
```

To avoid further confusion and potential security incidents, this functionality
was removed and now all namespace policies are required to have a label.

Tokens currently attached to an invalid policy will stop working after the
upgrade, so you should fix invalid policies to have an explicit namespace label
before upgrading Nomad.

After the policies are fixed, the existing tokens with those policies will
continue to work and do not need to be regenerated.

#### Command `nomad tls cert create` flag `-cluster-region` deprecated

Nomad 1.6.0 will deprecate the command `nomad tls cert create` flag `-cluster-region`
in favour of using the standard flag `-region`. The `-cluster-region` flag
will be removed in Nomad 1.7.0

#### 32-bit Intel Builds Deprecated

Starting with Nomad 1.6.0, HashiCorp will no longer release 32-bit Intel builds
of Nomad and Nomad Enterprise (the builds named `windows_386` and
`linux_386`). Bug fixes will continue to be backported to the 1.5.x and 1.4.x
versions so long as those major versions are still supported.

The 32-bit ARM build (`linux_arm` for the armhf architecture) is deprecated and
may be removed in a future major version of Nomad. The 32-bit ARM build is not
tested and may include bugs around platform-specific integer sizes. Using 64-bit
builds for small form-factor hosts such as the RaspberryPi is strongly
recommended.

## Nomad 1.5.7, 1.4.11

#### Namespace ACL policies require a label

Nomad 1.5.7 and 1.4.11 do not allow ACL policies for namespaces without a
label. Prior to these versions, ACL policies for namespaces were allowed to be
defined without a label, and the documented behavior in this case was that the
policy would be applied to the `default` namespace.

A bug in this logic caused the policy to be incorrectly applied to a different
namespace. For example, the policy below would be applied to a namespace called
`policy` instead of `default`.

```hcl
namespace {
  policy = "read"
}
```

To avoid further confusion and potential security incidents, this functionality
was removed and now all namespace policies are required to have a label.

Tokens currently attached to an invalid policy will stop working after the
upgrade, so you should fix invalid policies to have an explicit namespace label
before upgrading Nomad.

After the policies are fixed, the existing tokens with those policies will
continue to work and do not need to be regenerated.

## Nomad 1.5.5

Nomad 1.5.5 fixed a bug where allocations that are rescheduled for jobs
registered before the upgrade would no longer collect allocation logs. The
`logs.enabled` field introduced in 1.5.4 is now deprecated and has been replaced
by a `logs.disabled` field that defaults to false. The `logs.enabled` field value
will be ignored in 1.5.5 and will be removed in Nomad 1.6.0.

## Nomad 1.5.4

Nomad 1.5.4 included a bug where allocations that are rescheduled for jobs
registered before the upgrade would no longer collect allocation logs. The
client will emit debug-level logs like the following:

```
client.alloc_runner.task_runner.task_hook: log collection is disabled by task
```

You should avoid this version of Nomad and instead install the latest version of
Nomad 1.5. If you have already upgraded to Nomad 1.5.4, upgrading to Nomad 1.5.5
will restore logging collection when clients are restarted as part of the
upgrade process.

## Nomad 1.5.1

#### Artifact Download Regression Fix

Nomad 1.5.1 reverts a behavior of 1.5.0 where artifact downloads were executed
as the `nobody` user on compatible Linux systems. This was done optimistically
as defense against compromised artifact endpoints attempting to exploit the
Nomad Client or tools it uses to perform downloads such as git or mercurial.
Unfortunately running the child process as any user other than root is not
compatible with the advice given in Nomad's [security hardening guide](/nomad/docs/v1.5.x/install/production/requirements#hardening-nomad)
which calls for a specific directory tree structure making such operation impossible.

Other changes to artifact downloading remain - they are executed as a child
process of the Nomad agent, and on modern Linux systems make use of the Kernel
landlock feature to restrict filesystem access from that process.

## Nomad 1.5.0

#### Pause Container Reconciliation Regression

Nomad 1.5.0 introduced a regression to the way the Docker driver reconciles
dangling containers. This meant pause containers would be erroneously removed,
even though the allocation was still running. This would not affect the running
allocation, but does cause it to fail if it needs to restart. An immediate
workaround is to disable
[dangling container reconciliation](/nomad/docs/v1.5.x/drivers/docker#enabled).

#### Artifact Download Sandboxing

Nomad 1.5.0 changes the way [artifacts] are downloaded when specifying an `artifact`
in a task configuration. Previously the Nomad Client would download artifacts
in-process. External commands used to facilitate the download (e.g. `git`, `hg`)
would be run as `root`, and the resulting payload would be owned as `root` in the
allocation's task directory.

In an effort to improve the resilience and security model of the Nomad Client,
in 1.5.0 artifact downloads occur in a sub-process. Where possible, that
sub-process is run as the `nobody` user, and on modern Linux systems will
be isolated from the filesystem via the kernel's [landlock](https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/landlock.html) capability.

Operators are encouraged to ensure jobs making use of artifacts continue to work
as expected. In particular, git-ssh users will need to make sure the system-wide
`/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts` file is populated with any necessary remote hosts.
Previously, Nomad's documentation suggested configuring
`/root/.ssh/known_hosts` which would apply only to the `root` user.

The artifact downloader no longer inherits all environment variables available
to the Nomad Client. The downloader sub-process environment is set as follows on
Linux / macOS:

```
PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
TMPDIR=<path to task dir>/tmp
```

and as follows on Windows:

```
TMP=<path to task dir>\tmp
TEMP=<path to task dir>\tmp
PATH=<inherit $PATH>
HOMEPATH=<inherit $HOMEPATH>
HOMEDRIVE=<inherit $HOMEDRIVE>
USERPROFILE=<inherit $USERPROFILE>
```

Configuration of the artifact downloader should happen through the [`options`](/nomad/docs/v1.5.x/job-specification/artifact#artifact-parameters)
and `headers` fields of the `artifact` block. For backwards
compatibility, the sandbox can be configured to inherit specified environment variables
from the Nomad client by setting [`set_environment_variables`](/nomad/docs/v1.5.x/configuration/client#set_environment_variables).

The use of filesystem isolation can be disabled in Client configuration by
setting [`disable_filesystem_isolation`](/nomad/docs/v1.5.x/configuration/client#disable_filesystem_isolation).

#### Artifact Decompression Limits

Nomad 1.5.0 now sets default limits around artifact decompression. A single artifact
payload is now limited to 100GB and 4096 files when decompressed. An artifact that
exceeds these limits during decompression will cause the artifact downloader to
fail. These limits can be adjusted or disabled in the client artifact configuration
by setting [`decompression_size_limit`](/nomad/docs/v1.5.x/configuration/client#decompression_size_limit) and
[`decompression_file_count_limit`]( /nomad/docs/v1.5.x/configuration/client#decompression_file_count_limit).

#### Datacenter Wildcards

In Nomad 1.5.0, the
[`datacenters`](/nomad/docs/v1.5.x/job-specification/job#datacenters) field for a job
accepts wildcards for multi-character matching. For example, `datacenters =
["dc*"]` will match all datacenters that start with `"dc"`. The default value
for `datacenters` is now `["*"]`, so the field can be omitted.

The `*` character is no longer a legal character in the
[`datacenter`](/nomad/docs/configuration#datacenter) field for an agent
configuration. Before upgrading to Nomad 1.5.0, you should first ensure that
you've updated any jobs that currently have a `*` in their datacenter name and
then ensure that no agents have this character in their `datacenter` field name.

#### Server `rejoin_after_leave` (default: `false`) now enforced

All Nomad versions prior to v1.5.0 have incorrectly ignored the Server
[`rejoin_after_leave`](/nomad/docs/v1.5.x/configuration/server#rejoin_after_leave) configuration option. This bug has been fixed in Nomad
version v1.5.0.

Previous to v1.5.0 the behavior of Nomad `rejoin_after_leave` was always `true`,
regardless of Nomad server configuration, while the documentation incorrectly
indicated a default of `false`.

Cluster operators should be aware that explicit `leave` events (such as `nomad
server force-leave`) will now result in behavior which matches this
configuration, and should review whether they were inadvertently relying on the
buggy behavior.

#### Changes to eval broker metrics

The metric `nomad.nomad.broker.total_blocked` has been changed to
`nomad.nomad.broker.total_pending`. This state refers to internal state of the
leader's broker, and this is easily confused with the unrelated evaluation
status `"blocked"` in the Nomad API.

#### Deprecated gossip keyring commands removed

The commands `nomad operator keyring`, `nomad keyring`, `nomad operator keygen`,
and `nomad keygen` used to manage the gossip keyring were marked as deprecated
in Nomad 1.4.0. In Nomad 1.5.0, these commands have been removed. Use the `nomad
operator gossip keyring` commands to manage the gossip keyring.

#### Garbage collection of evaluations and allocations for batch job

Versions prior to 1.5.0 only delete evaluations and allocations of batch jobs
that are explicitly stopped which can lead to unbounded memory growth of Nomad
when the batch job is executed multiple times.

Nomad 1.5.0 introduces a new server configuration
[`batch_eval_gc_threshold`](/nomad/docs/v1.5.x/configuration/server#batch_eval_gc_threshold)
to control how allocations and evaluations for batch jobs are collected.

The default threshold is `24h`. If you need to access completed allocations for
batch jobs that are older than 24h you must increase this value when upgrading
Nomad.

## Nomad 1.4.5, 1.3.10

#### Pause Container Reconciliation Regression

Nomad 1.4.5 and 1.3.10 introduced a regression to the way the Docker driver
reconciles dangling containers. This meant pause containers would be erroneously
removed, even though the allocation was still running. This would not affect the
running allocation, but does cause it to fail if it needs to restart. An immediate
workaround is to disable
[dangling container reconciliation](/nomad/docs/v1.4.x/drivers/docker#enabled).

## Nomad 1.4.4, 1.3.9

#### Garbage collection of evaluations and allocations for batch job

Versions prior to 1.4.4 and 1.3.9 only delete evaluations and allocations of
batch jobs that are explicitly stopped which can lead to unbounded memory
growth of Nomad when the batch job is executed multiple times.

Nomad 1.4.4 and 1.3.9 introduces a new server configuration
[`batch_eval_gc_threshold`](/nomad/docs/v1.4.x/configuration/server#batch_eval_gc_threshold)
to control how allocations and evaluations for batch jobs are collected.

The default threshold is `24h`. If you need to access completed allocations for
batch jobs that are older than 24h you must increase this value when upgrading
Nomad.

## Nomad 1.4.0

#### Possible Panic During Upgrades

Nomad 1.4.0 initializes a keyring on the leader if one has not been previously
created, which writes a new raft entry. Users have reported that the keyring
initialization can cause a panic on older servers during upgrades. Following the
documented [upgrade process](/nomad/docs/v1.4.x/upgrade) closely will reduce the risk of this panic. But
if a server with version 1.4.0 becomes leader while servers with versions before
1.4.0 are still in the cluster, the older servers will panic.

The most likely scenario for this is if the leader is still on a version before
1.4.0 and is netsplit from the rest of the cluster or the server is restarted
without upgrading, and one of the 1.4.0 servers becomes the leader.

You can recover from the panic by immediately upgrading the old servers. This
bug was fixed in Nomad 1.4.1.

#### Raft Protocol Version 2 Unsupported

Raft protocol version 2 was deprecated in Nomad v1.3.0, and is being removed
in Nomad v1.4.0. In Nomad 1.3.0, the default raft protocol version was updated
to version 3, and in Nomad 1.4.0 Nomad requires the use of raft protocol version
3. If [`raft_protocol`](/nomad/docs/v1.4.x/configuration/server#raft_protocol) version is explicitly set, it must now be set to `3`.
For more information refer to the [Upgrading to Raft Protocol 3](/nomad/docs/v1.4.x/upgrade#upgrading-to-raft-protocol-3) guide.

#### Audit logs filtering logic changed

Audit Log filtering in previous versions of Nomad handled `stages` and
`operations` filters as `OR` filters. If _either_ condition was met, the logs
would be filtered. As of 1.4.0, `stages` and `operations` are treated as `AND
filters`. Logs will only be filtered if all filter conditions match.

#### Prevent Overlapping New Allocations with Stopping Allocations

Prior to Nomad 1.4.0 the scheduler would consider the resources used by
allocations that are in the process of stopping to be free for new allocations
to use. This could cause newer allocations to crash when they try to use TCP
ports or memory used by an allocation in the process of stopping. The new and
stopping [allocations would "overlap" improperly]( https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/10440).

[Nomad 1.4.0 fixes this behavior](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/pull/10446#issuecomment-1224833906) so that an allocation's resources
are only considered free for reuse once the client node the allocation was
running on reports it has stopped. Technically speaking: only once the
`Allocation.ClientStatus` has reached a terminal state (`complete`, `failed`,
or `lost`).

Despite this being a bug fix, it is considered a significant enough change in
behavior to reserve for a major Nomad release and *not* be backported. Please
report any negative side effects encountered as [new
issues](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/new/choose).

#### `nomad eval status -json` Without Evaluation ID Removed

Using `nomad eval status -json` without providing an evaluation ID was
deprecated in Nomad 1.2.4 with the intent to remove in Nomad 1.4.0. This option
has been removed. You can use `nomad eval list` to get a list of evaluations and
can use `nomad eval list -json` to get that list in JSON format. The `nomad eval
status <eval ID>` command will format a specific evaluation in JSON format if
the `-json` flag is provided.

#### Removing Vault/Consul from Clients

Nomad clients no longer have their Consul and Vault fingerprints cleared when
connectivity is lost with Consul and Vault. To intentionally remove Consul and
Vault from a client node, you will need to restart the Nomad client agent.

#### Numeric Operand Comparisons in Constraints

Prior to Nomad 1.4.0 the `<, <=, >, >=` operators in a constraint would always
compare the operands lexically. This behavior has been changed so that the comparison
is done numerically if both operands are integers or floats.

## Nomad 1.3.3

Environments that don't support the use of [`uid`](/nomad/docs/v1.3.x/job-specification/template#uid) and
[`gid`](/nomad/docs/v1.3.x/job-specification/template#gid) in `template` blocks, such as Windows clients, may
experience task failures with the following message after upgrading to Nomad
1.3.3:

```
Template failed: error rendering "(dynamic)" => "...": failed looking up user: managing file ownership is not supported on Windows
```

It is recommended to avoid this version of Nomad in such environments.

## Nomad 1.3.2, 1.2.9, 1.1.15

#### Client `max_kill_timeout` now enforced

Nomad versions since v0.9 have incorrectly ignored the Client [`max_kill_timeout`](/nomad/docs/v1.3.x/configuration/client#max_kill_timeout)
configuration option. This bug has been fixed in Nomad versions v.1.3.2,
v1.2.9, and v1.1.15. Job submitters should be aware that a Task's [`kill_timeout`](/nomad/docs/v1.3.x/job-specification/task#kill_timeout)
will be reduced to the Client's `max_kill_timeout` if the value exceeds the maximum.

## Nomad 1.3.1, 1.2.8, 1.1.14

#### Default `artifact` limits

Nomad 1.3.1, 1.2.8, and 1.1.14 introduced mechanisms to limit the size of
`artifact` downloads and how long these operations can take. The limits are
defined in the new `artifact` client configuration and have
predefined default values.

While the defaults set are fairly large, it is recommended to double-check them
prior to upgrading your Nomad clients to make sure they fit your needs.

## Nomad 1.3.0

#### Raft Protocol Version 2 Deprecation

Raft protocol version 2 will be removed from Nomad in the next major
release of Nomad, 1.4.0.

In Nomad 1.3.0, the default raft protocol version has been updated to
3. If the [`raft_protocol`](/nomad/docs/v1.3.x/configuration/server#raft_protocol) version is not explicitly set, upgrading a
server will automatically upgrade that server's raft protocol. Refer to the [Upgrading to Raft Protocol 3](/nomad/docs/v1.3.x/upgrade#upgrading-to-raft-protocol-3) guide.

#### Client State Store

The client state store will be automatically migrated to a new schema
version when upgrading a client.

Downgrading to a previous version of the client after upgrading it to
Nomad 1.3 is not supported. To downgrade safely, users should drain
all tasks from the Nomad client and erase its data directory.

#### CSI Plugins

The client filesystem layout for CSI plugins has been updated to
correctly handle the lifecycle of multiple allocations serving the
same plugin. Running plugin tasks will not be updated after upgrading
the client, but it is recommended to redeploy CSI plugin jobs after
upgrading the cluster.

The directory for plugin control sockets will be mounted from a new
per-allocation directory in the client data dir. This will still be
bind-mounted to `csi_plugin.mount_config` as in versions of Nomad
prior to 1.3.0.

The volume staging directory for new CSI plugin tasks will now be
mounted to the task's `NOMAD_TASK_DIR` instead of the
`csi_plugin.mount_config`.

#### Raft leadership transfer on error

Starting with Nomad 1.3.0, when a Nomad server is elected the Raft leader but
fails to complete the process to start acting as the Nomad leader it will
attempt to gracefully transfer its Raft leadership status to another eligible
server in the cluster. This operation is only supported when using Raft
Protocol Version 3.

#### Server Raft Database

The server raft database in `raft.db` will be automatically migrated to a new
underlying implementation provided by `go.etcd.io/bbolt`. Downgrading to a previous
version of the server after upgrading it to Nomad 1.3 is not supported. Like with
any Nomad upgrade it is recommended to take a snapshot of your database prior to
upgrading in case a downgrade becomes necessary.

The new database implementation enables a new server configuration option for
controlling the underlying freelist-sync behavior. Clusters experiencing extreme
disk IO on servers may want to consider disabling freelist-sync to reduce load.
The tradeoff is longer server startup times, as the database must be completely
scanned to re-build the freelist from scratch.

```hcl
server {
  raft_boltdb {
    no_freelist_sync = true
  }
}
```

#### Changes to the `nomad server members` command

The standard output of the `nomad server members` command replaces the previous
`Protocol` column that indicated the Serf protocol version with a new column
named `Raft Version` which outputs the Raft protocol version defined in each
server.

The `-detailed` flag is now called `-verbose` and outputs the standard values
in addition to extra information. The previous name is still supported but may
be removed in future releases.

The previous `Protocol` value can be viewed using the `-verbose` flag.

#### Changes to `client.template.function_denylist` configuration

consul-template v0.28 added a new function
[`writeToFile`](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template/blob/v0.28.0/docs/templating-language.md#writeToFile)
which can write to arbitrary files on the host.

Nomad 1.3.0 disables this function by default in its
[`function_denylist`](/nomad/docs/v1.3.x/configuration/client#function_denylist).

However *if you have overridden the default `template.function_denylist` in
your client configuration, you must add `writeToFile` to your denylist.*
Failing to do so allows templates to write to arbitrary paths on the host.

#### Changes to Envoy metrics labels

When using Envoy as a sidecar proxy for Connect enabled services, Nomad will now
automatically inject the unique allocation ID into Envoy's stats tags configuration.
Users who wish to set the tag values themselves may do so using the [`proxy.config`](/nomad/docs/v1.3.x/job-specification/proxy#config)
block.

```hcl
connect {
  sidecar_service {
    proxy {
      config {
        envoy_stats_tags = ["nomad.alloc_id=<allocID>"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Changes to Consul Connect Service Identity Tokens

Starting with Nomad 1.3.0, Consul Service Identity Tokens created automatically
by Nomad on behalf of Connect services will now be created as local tokens. These
tokens will no longer be replicated globally. To facilitate cross-Consul datacenter
requests of Connect services registered by Nomad, Consul agents will need to be
configured with default anonymous ACL tokens with ACL policies of
sufficient permissions to read service and node metadata pertaining to those
requests. This mechanism is described in [Consul issue 7414](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/7414)
A typical Consul agent anonymous token may contain an ACL policy such as:

```hcl
service_prefix "" { policy = "read" }
node_prefix    "" { policy = "read" }
```

The minimum version of Consul supported by Nomad's Connect integration is now Consul v1.8.0.

#### Changes to task groups that utilise Consul services and checks

Starting with Nomad 1.3.0, services and checks that utilise Consul will have an
automatic constraint placed upon the task group. This ensures they are placed
on a client with a Consul agent running that meets a minimum version
requirement. The minimum version of Consul supported by Nomad's service and
check blocks is now Consul v1.7.0.

#### Linux Control Groups Version 2

Starting with Nomad 1.3.0, Linux systems configured to use [cgroups v2](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html)
are now supported. A Nomad client will only activate its v2 control groups manager
if the system is configured with the cgroups2 controller mounted at `/sys/fs/cgroup`.
  * Systems that do not support cgroups v2 are not affected.
  * Systems configured in hybrid mode typically mount the cgroups2
    controller at `/sys/fs/cgroup/unified`, so Nomad will continue to
    use cgroups v1 for these hosts.
  * Systems configured with only cgroups v2 now correctly support setting cpu [cores].

Nomad will preserve the existing cgroup for tasks when a client is
upgraded, so there will be no disruption to tasks. A new client
attribute `unique.cgroup.version` indicates which version of control
groups Nomad is using.

When cgroups v2 are in use, Nomad uses `nomad.slice` as the [default
parent](/nomad/docs/v1.3.x/configuration/client#cgroup_parent) for cgroups
created on behalf of tasks. The cgroup created for a task is named in the form `<allocID>.<task>.scope`.
These cgroups are created by Nomad before a task starts. External task drivers that support
containerization should be updated to make use of the new cgroup locations.

The new cgroup file system layout will look like the following:

```shell-session
➜ tree -d /sys/fs/cgroup/nomad.slice
/sys/fs/cgroup/nomad.slice
├── 8b8da4cf-8ebf-b578-0bcf-77190749abf3.redis.scope
└── a8c8e495-83c8-311b-4657-e6e3127e98bc.example.scope
```
#### Support for pre-0.9 Tasks Removed

Running tasks that were created on clusters from Nomad version 0.9 or
earlier will fail to restore after upgrading a cluster to Nomad
1.3.0. To safely upgrade without unplanned interruptions, force these
tasks to be rescheduled by `nomad alloc stop` before upgrading. Note
this only applies to tasks that have been running continuously from
before 0.9 without rescheduling. Jobs that were created before 0.9 but
have had tasks replaced over time after 0.9 will operate normally
during the upgrade.

## Nomad 1.2.6, 1.1.12, and 1.0.18

#### ACL requirement for the job parse endpoint

Nomad 1.2.6, 1.1.12, and 1.0.18 require ACL authentication for the
[job parse](/nomad/api-docs/v1.2.x/jobs#parse-job) API endpoint. The `parse-job` capability has been
created to allow access to this endpoint. The `submit-job`, `read`, and `write`
policies include this capability.


The capability must be enabled for the namespace used in the API request.

## Nomad 1.2.4

#### `nomad eval status -json` deprecated

Nomad 1.2.4 includes a new `nomad eval list` command that has the
option to display the results in JSON format with the `-json`
flag. This replaces the existing `nomad eval status -json` option. In
Nomad 1.4.0, `nomad eval status -json` will be changed to display only
the selected evaluation in JSON format.

## Nomad 1.2.2

### Panic on node class filtering for system and sysbatch jobs fixed

Nomad 1.2.2 fixes a [server crashing bug](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/11563) present in the scheduler
node class filtering since 1.2.0. Users should upgrade to Nomad 1.2.2 to avoid
this problem.

## Nomad 1.2.0

#### Nvidia device plugin

The Nvidia device is now an external plugin and must be installed separately.
Refer to [the Nvidia device plugin's documentation][nvidia] for details.

#### ACL requirements for accessing the job details page in the Nomad UI

Nomad 1.2.0 introduced a new UI component to display the status of `system` and
`sysbatch` jobs in each client where they are running. This feature makes an
API call to an endpoint that requires `node:read` ACL permission. Tokens used
to access the Nomad UI will need to be updated to include this permission in
order to access a job details page.

This was an unintended change fixed in Nomad 1.2.4.

#### HCLv2 Job Specification Parsing

In previous versions of Nomad, when rendering a job specification using override
variables, a warning would be returned if a variable within an override file
was declared that was not found within the job specification. This behaviour
differed from passing variables via the `-var` flag, which would always cause an
error in the same situation.

Nomad 1.2.0 fixed the behaviour consistency to always return an error by default,
where an override variable was specified which was not a known variable within the
job specification. In order to mitigate this change for users who wish to only
be warned when this situation arises, the `-hcl-strict=false` flag can be
specified.

## Nomad 1.0.11 and 1.1.5 Enterprise

#### Audit log file names

Audit log file naming now matches the standard log file naming introduced in
1.0.10 and 1.1.4. The audit log currently being written will no longer have a
timestamp appended.

## Nomad 1.0.10 and 1.1.4

#### Log file names

The [`log_file`](/nomad/docs/v1.1.x/configuration#log_file) configuration option was not being fully respected, as the
generated filename would include a timestamp. After upgrade, the active log
file will always be the value defined in `log_file`, with timestamped files
being created during log rotation.

## Nomad 1.0.9 and 1.1.3

#### Namespace in Job Run and Plan APIs

The Job Run and Plan APIs now respect the `?namespace=...` query parameter over
the namespace specified in the job itself. This matches the precedence of
region and [fixes a bug where the `-namespace` flag was not respected for the
`nomad run` and `nomad apply` commands]( https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/pull/10875).

For users of [`api.Client`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/nomad/api#Client) who want their job namespace respected,
you must ensure the `Config.Namespace` field is unset.

#### Docker Driver

**1.1.3 only**

Starting in Nomad 1.1.2, task groups with `network.mode = "bridge"` generated a
hosts file in Docker containers. This generated hosts file was bind-mounted
from the task directory to `/etc/hosts` within the task. In Nomad 1.1.3 the
source for the bind mount was moved to the allocation directory so that it is
shared between all tasks in an allocation.

Please note that this change may prevent [`extra_hosts`](/nomad/docs/v1.1.x/drivers/docker#extra_hosts) values from being
properly set in each task when there are multiple tasks within the same group.
When using `extra_hosts` with Consul Connect in `bridge` network mode, you
should set the hosts values in the [`sidecar_task.config`](/nomad/docs/v1.1.x/job-specification/sidecar_task#config) block instead.

## Nomad 1.1.0

#### Enterprise licenses

Nomad Enterprise licenses are no longer stored in raft or synced between
servers. Nomad Enterprise servers will not start without a license. There is
no longer a six hour evaluation period when running Nomad Enterprise. Before
upgrading, you must provide each server with a license on disk or in its
environment. Refer to the Enterprise licensing documentation for details.

The `nomad license put` command has been removed.

The `nomad license get` command is no longer forwarded to the Nomad leader,
and will return the license from the specific server being contacted.

Visit the [Enterprise licensing page](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/nomad/trial) to get a trial license for Nomad Enterprise.

#### Agent Metrics API

The Nomad agent metrics API now respects the
[`prometheus_metrics`](/nomad/docs/v1.1.x/configuration/telemetry#prometheus_metrics)
configuration value. If this value is set to `false`, which is the default value,
calling `/v1/metrics?format=prometheus` will now result in a response error.

#### CSI volumes

The volume specification for CSI volumes has been updated to support volume
creation. The `access_mode` and `attachment_mode` fields have been moved to a
`capability` block that can be repeated. Existing registered volumes will be
automatically modified the next time that a volume claim is updated. Volume
specification files for new volumes should be updated to the format described
in the [`volume create`](/nomad/docs/v1.1.x/commands/volume/create) and [`volume register`](/nomad/docs/v1.1.x/commands/volume/register) commands.

The [`volume`](/nomad/docs/v1.1.x/job-specification/volume) block has an `access_mode` and `attachment_mode` field that are
required for CSI volumes. Jobs that use CSI volumes should be updated with
these fields.

#### Connect native tasks

Connect native tasks running in host networking mode will now have `CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR`
set automatically. Before this was only the case for bridge networking. If an operator
already explicitly set `CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR` then it will not get overridden.

#### Linux capabilities in exec/java

Following the security [remediation](/nomad/docs/v1.1.x/upgrade/upgrade-specific#nomad-1-1-0-rc1-1-0-5-0-12-12) in Nomad versions 0.12.12, 1.0.5,
and 1.1.0-rc1, the `exec` and `java` task drivers will additionally no longer enable
the following linux capabilities by default.

```
AUDIT_CONTROL  AUDIT_READ  BLOCK_SUSPEND  DAC_READ_SEARCH  IPC_LOCK  IPC_OWNER  LEASE
LINUX_IMMUTABLE  MAC_ADMIN  MAC_OVERRIDE  NET_ADMIN  NET_BROADCAST  NET_RAW  SYS_ADMIN
SYS_BOOT  SYSLOG  SYS_MODULE  SYS_NICE  SYS_PACCT  SYS_PTRACE  SYS_RAWIO  SYS_RESOURCE
SYS_TIME  SYS_TTY_CONFIG  WAKE_ALARM
```

The capabilities now enabled by default are modeled after Docker default
[`linux capabilities`]( https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities) (excluding `NET_RAW`).

```
AUDIT_WRITE  CHOWN  DAC_OVERRIDE  FOWNER  FSETID  KILL  MKNOD  NET_BIND_SERVICE
SETFCAP  SETGID  SETPCAP  SETUID  SYS_CHROOT
```

A new `allow_caps` plugin configuration parameter for [`exec`][allow_caps_exec]
and [`java`](/nomad/docs/v1.1.x/drivers/java#allow_caps) task drivers can be used to restrict the set of
capabilities allowed for use by tasks.

Tasks using the `exec` or `java` task drivers can add or remove desired linux
capabilities using the [`cap_add`](/nomad/docs/v1.1.x/drivers/exec#cap_add) and [`cap_drop`](/nomad/docs/v1.1.x/drivers/exec#cap_drop)
task configuration options.

#### iptables

Nomad now appends its iptables rules to the `NOMAD-ADMIN` chain instead of
inserting them as the first rule. This allows better control for user-defined
iptables rules but users who append rules currently should verify that their
rules are being appended in the correct order.

## Nomad 1.1.0-rc1, 1.0.5, 0.12.12

Nomad versions 1.1.0-rc1, 1.0.5 and 0.12.12 change the behavior of the `docker`, `exec`,
and `java` task drivers so that the `CAP_NET_RAW` Linux capability is disabled
by default. This is one of the Linux capabilities that Docker itself enables
by default, as this capability enables the generation of ICMP packets - used by
the common `ping` utility for performing network diagnostics. When used by groups in
`bridge` networking mode, the `CAP_NET_RAW` capability also exposes tasks to ARP spoofing,
enabling DoS and MITM attacks against other tasks running in `bridge` networking
on the same host. Operators should weigh potential impact of an upgrade on their
applications against the security consequences inherit with `CAP_NET_RAW`. Typical
applications using `tcp` or `udp` based networking should not be affected.

This is the sole change for Nomad 1.0.5 and 0.12.12, intended to provide better
task network isolation by default.

Users of the `docker` driver can restore the previous behavior by configuring the
[`allow_caps`](/nomad/docs/v1.1.0/drivers/docker#allow_caps) driver configuration option to explicitly enable the `CAP_NET_RAW`
capability.

```hcl
plugin "docker" {
  config {
    allow_caps = [
      "CHOWN", "DAC_OVERRIDE", "FSETID", "FOWNER", "MKNOD",
      "SETGID", "SETUID", "SETFCAP", "SETPCAP", "NET_BIND_SERVICE",
      "SYS_CHROOT", "KILL", "AUDIT_WRITE", "NET_RAW",
    ]
  }
}
```

An upcoming version of Nomad will include similar configuration options for the
`exec` and `java` task drivers.

This change is limited to `docker`, `exec`, and `java` driver plugins. It does
not affect the Nomad server. This only affects Nomad clients running Linux, with
tasks using `bridge` networking and one of these task drivers, or third-party
plugins which relied on the shared Nomad executor library.

Upgrading a Nomad client to 1.0.5 or 0.12.12 will not restart existing tasks. As
such, processes from existing `docker`, `exec`, or `java` tasks will need to be
manually restarted (using `alloc stop` or another mechanism) in order to be
fully isolated.

## Nomad 1.0.3, 0.12.10

Nomad versions 1.0.3 and 0.12.10 change the behavior of the `exec` and `java` drivers so that
tasks are isolated in their own PID and IPC namespaces. As a result, the
process launched by these drivers will be PID 1 in the namespace. This has
[significant impact](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pid_namespaces.7.html)
on the treatment of a process by the Linux kernel. Furthermore, tasks in the
same allocation will no longer be able to coordinate using signals, SystemV IPC
objects, or POSIX message queues. Operators should weigh potential impact of an
upgrade on their applications against the security consequences inherent in using
the host namespaces.

This is the sole change for Nomad 1.0.3, intended to provide better process
isolation by default. An upcoming version of Nomad will include options for
configuring this behavior.

This change is limited to the `exec` and `java` driver plugins. It does not affect
the Nomad server. This only affect Nomad clients running on Linux, using the
`exec` or `java` drivers or third-party driver plugins which relied on the shared
Nomad executor library.

Upgrading a Nomad client to 1.0.3 or 0.12.10 will not restart existing tasks.
As such, processes from existing `exec`/`java` tasks will need to be manually restarted
(using `alloc stop` or another mechanism) in order to be fully isolated.

## Nomad 1.0.2

#### Dynamic secrets trigger template changes on client restart

Nomad 1.0.2 changed the behavior of template `change_mode` triggers when a
client node restarts. In Nomad 1.0.1 and earlier, the first rendering of a
template after a client restart would not trigger the `change_mode`. For
dynamic secrets such as the Vault PKI secrets engine, this resulted in the
secret being updated but not restarting or signalling the task. When the
secret's lease expired at some later time, the task workload might fail
because of the stale secret. For example, a web server's SSL certificate would
be expired and browsers would be unable to connect.

In Nomad 1.0.2, when a client node is restarted any task with Vault secrets
that are generated or have expired will have its `change_mode` triggered. If
`change_mode = "restart"` this will result in the task being restarted, to
avoid the task failing unexpectedly at some point in the future. This change
only impacts tasks using dynamic Vault secrets engines such as PKI, or
when secrets are rotated. Secrets that don't change in Vault will not trigger
a `change_mode` on client restart.

## Nomad 1.0.1

#### Envoy worker threads

Nomad v1.0.0 changed the default behavior around the number of worker threads
created by the Envoy when being used as a sidecar for Consul Connect. In Nomad
v1.0.1, the same default setting of [`--concurrency=1`](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/operations/cli#cmdoption-concurrency) is set for Envoy when used
as a Connect gateway. As before, the [`meta.connect.proxy_concurrency`][proxy_concurrency]
property can be set in client configuration to override the default value.

## Nomad 1.0.0

### HCL2 for Job specification

Nomad v1.0.0 adopts HCL2 for parsing the job spec. HCL2 extends HCL with more
expression and reuse support, but adds some stricter schema for HCL blocks
(a.k.a. blocks). Check [HCL](/nomad/docs/v1.0.x/job-specification/hcl2) for more details.

### Signal used when stopping Docker tasks

When stopping tasks running with the Docker task driver, Nomad documents that a
`SIGTERM` will be issued (unless configured with `kill_signal`). However, recent
versions of Nomad would issue `SIGINT` instead. Starting again with Nomad v1.0.0
`SIGTERM` will be sent by default when stopping Docker tasks.

### Deprecated metrics have been removed

Nomad v0.7.0 added supported for tagged metrics and deprecated untagged metrics.
There was support for configuring backwards-compatible metrics. This support has
been removed with v1.0.0, and all metrics will be emitted with tags.

### Null characters in region, datacenter, job name/ID, task group name, and task names

Starting with Nomad v1.0.0, jobs will fail validation if any of the following
contain null character: the job ID or name, the task group name, or the task
name. Any jobs meeting this requirement should be modified before an update to
v1.0.0. Similarly, client and server config validation will prohibit either the
region or the datacenter from containing null characters.

### EC2 CPU characteristics may be different

Starting with Nomad v1.0.0, the AWS fingerprinter uses data derived from the
official AWS EC2 API to determine default CPU performance characteristics,
including core count and core speed. This data should be accurate for each
instance type per region. Previously, Nomad used a hand-made lookup table that
was not region aware and may have contained inaccurate or incomplete data. As
part of this change, the AWS fingerprinter no longer sets the `cpu.modelname`
attribute.

As before, `cpu_total_compute` can be used to override the discovered CPU
resources available to the Nomad client.

### Inclusive language

Starting with Nomad v1.0.0, the terms `blacklist` and `whitelist` have been
deprecated from client configuration and driver configuration. The existing
configuration values are permitted but will be removed in a future version of
Nomad. The specific configuration values replaced are:

- Client `driver.blacklist` is replaced with `driver.denylist`.

- Client `driver.whitelist` is replaced with `driver.allowlist`.

- Client `env.blacklist` is replaced with `env.denylist`.

- Client `fingerprint.blacklist` is replaced with `fingerprint.denylist`.

- Client `fingerprint.whitelist` is replaced with `fingerprint.allowlist`.

- Client `user.blacklist` is replaced with `user.denylist`.

- Client `template.function_blacklist` is replaced with
  `template.function_denylist`.

- Docker driver `docker.caps.whitelist` is replaced with
  `docker.caps.allowlist`.

### Consul Connect

Nomad 1.0's Consul Connect integration works best with Consul 1.9 or later. The
ideal upgrade path is:

1. Create a new Nomad client image with Nomad 1.0 and Consul 1.9 or later.
2. Add new hosts based on the image.
3. [Drain](/nomad/docs/v1.0.x/commands/node/drain) and shutdown old Nomad client nodes.

While inplace upgrades and older versions of Consul are supported by Nomad 1.0,
Envoy proxies will drop and stop accepting connections while the Nomad agent is
restarting. Nomad 1.0 with Consul 1.9 do not have this limitation.

#### Envoy proxy versions

Nomad v1.0.0 changes the behavior around the selection of Envoy version used for
Connect sidecar proxies. Previously, Nomad always defaulted to Envoy v1.11.2 if
neither the `meta.connect.sidecar_image` parameter or `sidecar_task` block were
explicitly configured. Likewise the same version of Envoy would be used for
Connect ingress gateways if `meta.connect.gateway_image` was unset. Starting
with Nomad v1.0.0, each Nomad Client will query Consul for a list of supported
Envoy versions. Nomad will make use of the latest version of Envoy supported by
the Consul agent when launching Envoy as a Connect sidecar proxy. If the version
of the Consul agent is older than v1.7.8, v1.8.4, or v1.9.0, Nomad will fallback
to the v1.11.2 version of Envoy. As before, if the `meta.connect.sidecar_image`,
`meta.connect.gateway_image`, or `sidecar_task` block are set, those settings
take precedence.

When upgrading Nomad Clients from a previous version to v1.0.0 and above, it is
recommended to also upgrade the Consul agents to v1.7.8, 1.8.4, or v1.9.0 or
newer. Upgrading Nomad and Consul to versions that support the new behavior
while also doing a full [node drain](/nomad/docs/v1.0.x/upgrade#5-upgrade-clients) at the time of the upgrade for each node
will ensure Connect workloads are properly rescheduled onto nodes in such a way
that the Nomad Clients, Consul agents, and Envoy sidecar tasks maintain
compatibility with one another.

#### Envoy worker threads

Nomad v1.0.0 changes the default behavior around the number of worker threads
created by the Envoy sidecar proxy when using Consul Connect. Previously, the
Envoy [`--concurrency`](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/operations/cli#cmdoption-concurrency) argument was left unset, which caused
Envoy to spawn as many worker threads as logical cores available on the CPU. The
`--concurrency` value now defaults to `1` and can be configured by setting the
[`meta.connect.proxy_concurrency`](/nomad/docs/v1.0.x/job-specification/sidecar_task#proxy_concurrency) property in client
configuration.

## Nomad 0.12.8

### Docker volume mounts

Nomad 0.12.8 includes security fixes for the handling of Docker volume mounts:

- The `docker.volumes.enabled` flag now defaults to `false` as documented.

- Docker driver mounts of type "volume" (but not "bind") were not sandboxed and
  could mount arbitrary locations from the client host. The
  `docker.volumes.enabled` configuration will now disable Docker mounts with
  type "volume" when set to `false` (the default).

This change Docker impacts jobs that use a `mounts` with type "volume", as shown
below. This job will fail when placed unless `docker.volumes.enabled = true`.

```hcl
mounts = [
  {
    type     = "volume"
    target   = "/path/in/container"
    source   = "docker_volume"
    volume_options = {
      driver_config = {
        name = "local"
        options = [
          {
            device = "/"
            o      = "ro,bind"
            type   = "ext4"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
]
```

## Nomad 0.12.6

### Artifact and Template Paths

Nomad 0.12.6 includes security fixes for privilege escalation vulnerabilities
in handling of job `template` and `artifact` blocks:

- The `template.source` and `template.destination` fields are now protected by
  the file sandbox introduced in 0.9.6. These paths are now restricted to fall
  inside the task directory by default. An operator can opt-out of this
  protection with the [`template.disable_file_sandbox`](/nomad/docs/v0.12.x/configuration/client#template-parameters) field in the client
  configuration.

- The paths for `template.source`, `template.destination`, and
  `artifact.destination` are validated on job submission to ensure the paths do
  not escape the file sandbox. It was possible to use interpolation to bypass
  this validation. The client now interpolates the paths before checking if they
  are in the file sandbox.

~> **Warning:** Due to a [bug](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/9148) in Nomad v0.12.6, the
`template.destination` and `artifact.destination` paths do not support
absolute paths, including the interpolated `NOMAD_SECRETS_DIR`,
`NOMAD_TASK_DIR`, and `NOMAD_ALLOC_DIR` variables. This bug is fixed in
v0.12.9. To work around the bug, use a relative path.

## Nomad 0.12.0

### `mbits` and Task Network Resource deprecation

Starting in Nomad 0.12.0 the `mbits` field of the network resource block has
been deprecated and is no longer considered when making scheduling decisions.
This is in part because we felt that `mbits` didn't accurately account network
bandwidth as a resource.

Additionally the use of the `network` block inside of a task's `resource` block
is also deprecated. Users are advised to move their `network` block to the
`group` block. Recent networking features have only been added to group based
network configuration. If any usecase or feature which was available with task
network resource is not fulfilled with group network configuration, please open
an issue detailing the missing capability.

Additionally, the `docker` driver's `port_map` configuration is deprecated in
lieu of the `ports` field.

### Enterprise Licensing

Enterprise binaries for Nomad are now publicly available via
[releases.hashicorp.com](https://releases.hashicorp.com/nomad/). By default all
enterprise features are enabled for 6 hours. During that time enterprise users
should apply their license with the [`nomad license put ...`](/nomad/docs/v0.12.x/commands/license/put) command.

Once the 6 hour demonstration period expires, Nomad will shutdown. If restarted
Nomad will shutdown in a very short amount of time unless a valid license is
applied.

~> **Warning:** Due to a [bug](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/8457) in Nomad v0.12.0, existing clusters
that are upgraded will **not** have 6 hours to apply a license. The minimal
grace period should be sufficient to apply a valid license, but enterprise
users are encouraged to delay upgrading until Nomad v0.12.1 is released and
fixes the issue.

### Docker access host filesystem

Nomad 0.12.0 disables Docker tasks access to the host filesystem, by default.
Prior to Nomad 0.12, Docker tasks may mount and then manipulate any host file
and may pose a security risk.

Operators now must explicitly allow tasks to access host filesystem. [Host
Volumes](/nomad/docs/v0.12.x/configuration/client#host_volume-block) provide a fine tune
access to individual paths.

To restore pre-0.12.0 behavior, you can enable [Docker
`volume`](/nomad/docs/v0.12.x/drivers/docker#enabled-1) to allow binding host paths, by adding
the following to the nomad client config file:

```hcl
plugin "docker" {
  config {
    volumes {
      enabled = true
    }
  }
}
```

### QEMU images

Nomad 0.12.0 restricts the paths the QEMU tasks can load an image from. A QEMU
task may download an image to the allocation directory to load. But images
outside the allocation directories must be explicitly allowed by operators in
the client agent configuration file.

For example, you may allow loading QEMU images from `/mnt/qemu-images` by
adding the following to the agent configuration file:

```hcl
plugin "qemu" {
  config {
    image_paths = ["/mnt/qemu-images"]
  }
}
```

## Nomad 0.11.7

### Docker volume mounts

Nomad 0.11.7 includes a security fix for the handling of Docker volume
mounts. Docker driver mounts of type "volume" (but not "bind") were not
sandboxed and could mount arbitrary locations from the client host. The
`docker.volumes.enabled` configuration will now disable Docker mounts with
type "volume" when set to `false`.

This change Docker impacts jobs that use a `mounts` with type "volume", as
shown below. This job will fail when placed unless `docker.volumes.enabled = true`.

```hcl
mounts = [
  {
    type     = "volume"
    target   = "/path/in/container"
    source   = "docker_volume"
    volume_options = {
      driver_config = {
        name = "local"
        options = [
          {
            device = "/"
            o      = "ro,bind"
            type   = "ext4"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
]
```

## Nomad 0.11.5

### Artifact and Template Paths

Nomad 0.11.5 includes backported security fixes for privilege escalation
vulnerabilities in handling of job `template` and `artifact` blocks:

- The `template.source` and `template.destination` fields are now protected by
  the file sandbox introduced in 0.9.6. These paths are now restricted to fall
  inside the task directory by default. An operator can opt-out of this
  protection with the
  [`template.disable_file_sandbox`](/nomad/docs/v0.11.x/configuration/client#template-parameters)
  field in the client configuration.
- The paths for `template.source`, `template.destination`, and
  `artifact.destination` are validated on job submission to ensure the paths
  do not escape the file sandbox. It was possible to use interpolation to
  bypass this validation. The client now interpolates the paths before
  checking if they are in the file sandbox.

~> **Warning:** Due to a [bug](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/9148) in Nomad v0.11.5, the
`template.destination` and `artifact.destination` paths do not support
absolute paths, including the interpolated `NOMAD_SECRETS_DIR`,
`NOMAD_TASK_DIR`, and `NOMAD_ALLOC_DIR` variables. This bug is fixed in
v0.11.6. To work around the bug, use a relative path.

## Nomad 0.11.3

Nomad 0.11.3 fixes a critical bug causing the nomad agent to become
unresponsive. The issue is due to a [Go 1.14.1 runtime
bug](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/38023) and affects Nomad 0.11.1 and
0.11.2.

## Nomad 0.11.2

### Scheduler Scoring Changes

Prior to Nomad 0.11.2 the scheduler algorithm used a [node's reserved
resources](/nomad/docs/v0.11.x/configuration/client#reserved-parameters)
incorrectly during scoring. The result of this bug was that scoring biased in
favor of nodes with reserved resources vs nodes without reserved resources.

Placements will be more correct but slightly different in v0.11.2 vs earlier
versions of Nomad. Operators do _not_ need to take any actions as the impact of
the bug fix will only minimally affect scoring.

Feasibility (whether a node is capable of running a job at all) is _not_
affected.

### Periodic Jobs and Daylight Saving Time

Nomad 0.11.2 fixed a long outstanding bug affecting periodic jobs that are
scheduled to run during Daylight Saving Time transitions.

Nomad 0.11.2 provides a more defined behavior: Nomad evaluates the cron
expression with respect to specified time zone during transition. A 2:30am
nightly job with `America/New_York` time zone will not run on the day daylight
saving time starts; similarly, a 1:30am nightly job will run twice on the day
daylight saving time ends. See the [Daylight Saving Time](/nomad/docs/v0.11.x/job-specification/periodic#daylight-saving-time) documentation
for details.

## Nomad 0.11.0

### client.template: `vault_grace` deprecation

Nomad 0.11.0 updates
[consul-template](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template) to v0.24.1. This
library deprecates the [`vault_grace`](/nomad/docs/v0.11.x/job-specification/template) option for templating
included in Nomad. The feature has been ignored since Vault 0.5 and as long as
you are running a more recent version of Vault, you can safely remove
`vault_grace` from your Nomad jobs.

### Rkt Task Driver Removed

The `rkt` task driver has been deprecated and removed from Nomad. While the code
is available in the [external `nomad-driver-rkt` repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad-driver-rk), it will not be maintained as
`rkt` is [no longer being developed upstream](https://github.com/rkt/rkt). We
encourage all `rkt` users to find a new task driver as soon as possible.

## Nomad 0.10 and earlier

Refer to the [Nomad releases page](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/releases) in the Nomad repo for prior release changelogs.
