# Command: volume deregister

The `volume deregister` command deregisters external storage volumes with
Nomad's [Container Storage Interface (CSI)][csi] support. The volume
must exist on the remote storage provider before it can be deregistered
and used by a task.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad volume deregister [options] [volume]
```

The `volume deregister` command requires a single argument, specifying
the ID of volume to be deregistered. Deregistration will fail if the
volume is still in use by an allocation or in the process of being
unpublished.
