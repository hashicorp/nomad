  It is possible to deploy and consume stateful workloads in Nomad. Nomad can
  integrate with various storage solutions such as Portworx and REX-Ray.

# Stateful Workloads

Nomad allows a user to mount persistent data from local or remote storage volumes
into task environments in a couple of ways â€” host volume mounts or Docker Volume
drivers.

Nomad host volumes allow you to mount any directory on the Nomad client into an
allocation. These mounts can then be connected to individual tasks within a task
group.

The Docker task driver's support for [volumes][docker-volumes] enables Nomad to
integrate with software-defined storage (SDS) solutions like
[Portworx][portworx] to support stateful workloads. Please keep in mind that
Nomad does not actually manage storage pools or replication as these tasks are
delegated to the SDS providers. Please assess all factors and risks when
utilizing such providers to run stateful workloads (such as your production
database).

Please refer to the specific documentation links below or in the sidebar for
more detailed information about using specific storage integrations.
