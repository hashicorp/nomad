# Device driver plugins

Use device driver plugins to detect and make devices available to tasks in
Nomad jobs. Devices are physical hardware that exists on a client node such as a
GPU or an FPGA. By having extensible device plugins, Nomad has the flexibility
to support a broad set of devices and allows the community to build additional
device plugins as needed.

## Nomad device drivers

We support the [NVIDIA] device driver plugin, which you must install
separately. Refer to the [NVIDIA] documentation for instructions.

## Community device drivers

The community supports the [USB] device driver plugin.

## Create device drivers

Nomad's device driver architecture is pluggable, which gives you the flexibility
to create your own drivers without having to recompile Nomad. Refer to the
[plugin authoring guide][plugin_guide] for details.
