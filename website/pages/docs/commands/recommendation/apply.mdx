# Command: recommendation apply

The `recommendation apply` command is used to apply recommendations.

~> Recommendation commands are new in Nomad 1.0 and are only available with
Nomad Enterprise.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad recommendation apply [options] <recommendation_ids>
```

The `recommendation apply` command requires at least one recommendation ID to
be passed to it. Multiple IDs can be passed, with each recommendation ID
separated from the next by a space.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the `submit-job`,
`read-job`, and `submit-recommendation` capabilities for the recommendation's
namespace.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Apply Options

- `-detach`: Return immediately instead of entering monitor mode. After applying
  a recommendation, the evaluation ID will be printed to the screen, which can
  be used to examine the evaluation using the [`eval status`][/docs/commands/eval-status] command. If applying
  recommendations for multiple jobs, this value will always be true.

- `-policy-override`: If set, any soft mandatory Sentinel policies will be
  overridden. This allows a recommendation to be applied when it would be denied
  by a policy.

- `-verbose`: Display full information.

## Examples

Apply a single recommendation and enter monitor mode:

```shell-session
$ nomad recommendation apply a9c041c5-3c04-aa24-bd55-0a80cded4f10
==> Monitoring evaluation "529cc88e"
    Evaluation triggered by job "job1"
    Evaluation within deployment: "28a3378f"
    Allocation "2a4df8ca" created: node "2f0a2f93", group "group1"
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "529cc88e" finished with status "complete"
```

Apply multiple recommendations for different jobs:

```shell-session
$ nomad recommendation apply a9c041c5-3c04-aa24-bd55-0a80cded4f10 811900b6-da11-ef08-f515-f5e6684007a8
