# `acl` Block

<Placement groups={['acl']} />

The `acl` block configures the Nomad agent to enable ACLs and tunes various
ACL parameters. Learn more about configuring Nomad's ACL system in the [Secure
Nomad with Access Control guide][secure-guide].

```hcl
acl {
  enabled    = true
  token_ttl  = "30s"
  policy_ttl = "60s"
  role_ttl   = "60s"
}
```

## `acl` Parameters

- `enabled` `(bool: false)` - Specifies if ACL enforcement is enabled. All other
  ACL configuration options depend on this value. Note that the Nomad command
  line client will send requests for client endpoints such as `alloc exec`
  directly to Nomad clients whenever they are accessible. In this scenario, the
  client will enforce ACLs, so both servers and clients should have ACLs enabled.

- `token_ttl` `(string: "30s")` - Specifies the maximum time-to-live (TTL) for
  cached ACL tokens. This does not affect servers, since they do not cache tokens.
  Setting this value lower reduces how stale a token can be, but increases
  the request load against servers. If a client cannot reach a server, for example
  because of an outage, the TTL will be ignored and the cached value used.

- `policy_ttl` `(string: "30s")` - Specifies the maximum time-to-live (TTL) for
  cached ACL policies. This does not affect servers, since they do not cache policies.
  Setting this value lower reduces how stale a policy can be, but increases
  the request load against servers. If a client cannot reach a server, for example
  because of an outage, the TTL will be ignored and the cached value used.

- `role_ttl` `(string: "30s")` - Specifies the maximum time-to-live (TTL) for
  cached ACL roles. This does not affect servers, since they do not cache roles.
  Setting this value lower reduces how stale a role can be, but increases the
  request load against servers. If a client cannot reach a server, for example
  because of an outage, the TTL will be ignored and the cached value used.

- `replication_token` `(string: "")` - Specifies the Secret ID of the ACL token
  to use for replicating policies and tokens. This is used by servers in non-authoritative
  region to mirror the policies and tokens into the local region from [authoritative_region][authoritative-region].

- `token_min_expiration_ttl` `(string: "1m")` - Specifies the lowest acceptable
  TTL value for an ACL token when setting expiration. This is used by the Nomad
  servers to validate ACL tokens.

- `token_max_expiration_ttl` `(string: "24h")` - Specifies the highest acceptable
  TTL value for an ACL token when setting expiration. This is used by the Nomad
  servers to validate ACL tokens.
