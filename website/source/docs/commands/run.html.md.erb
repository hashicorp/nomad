# Command: run

The `run` command is used to run new jobs in Nomad. Jobs are specified using
[HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl)-encoded files, and may specify one or
more task groups. More information about jobs and their configuration format
can be found in the [jobs documentation](#).

## Usage

```
nomad run [options] <file>
```

The run command requires a single argument, specifying the path to a file
containing a valid [job definition](#). This file will be read and the job
will be submitted to the Nomad server for scheduling.

By default, on sucessful job submission, the run command will enter an
interactive monitor and display log information detailing the scheduling
decisions and placement information for the provided job. The monitor will
exit after scheduling has finished or failed.

## General Options

<%= general_options_usage %>

## Run Options

* `-detach`: Return immediately instead of monitoring. A new evaluation ID
  will be output, which can be used to call the monitor later using the
  [eval-monitor](/docs/commands/eval-monitor.html) command.

## Examples

Stop a running job and monitor shutdown:

```
$ nomad stop job1
==> Monitoring evaluation "d00797d8-7bc3-fbc7-ae0d-5af0260a871f"
    2015/09/17 23:21:23 Evaluation status changed: "" -> "pending"
    2015/09/17 23:21:24 Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "d00797d8-7bc3-fbc7-ae0d-5af0260a871f" finished with status "complete"
```

Stop a running job and return immediately:

```
$ nomad stop -detach job1

```
