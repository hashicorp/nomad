## 0.9.2 (June 5, 2019)

SECURITY:

 * driver/exec: Fix privilege escalation issue introduced in Nomad 0.9.0.  In
   Nomad 0.9.0 and 0.9.1, exec tasks by default run as `nobody` but with
   elevated capabilities, allowing tasks to perform privileged linux operations
   and potentially escalate permissions. (CVE-2019-12618)
   [[GH-5728](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/pull/5728)]

__BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:__

 * api: The `api` package removed `Config.SetTimeout` and `Config.ConfigureTLS` functions, intended
   to be used internally only. [[GH-5275](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/pull/5275)]
 * api: The [job deployments](https://www.nomadproject.io/api/jobs.html#list-job-deployments) endpoint
   now filters out deployments associated with older instances of the job. This can happen if jobs are
   purged and recreated with the same id. To get all deployments irrespective of creation time, add
   `all=true`. The `nomad job deployment`CLI also defaults to doing this filtering. [[GH-5702](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/5702)]
 * client: The format of service IDs in Consul has changed. If you rely upon
   Nomad's service IDs (*not* service names; those are stable), you will need
   to update your code.  [[GH-5536](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/pull/5536)]
 * client: The format of check IDs in Consul has changed. If you rely upon
   Nomad's check IDs you will need to update your code.  [[GH-5536](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/pull/5536)]
 * client: On startup a client will reattach to running tasks as before but
   will not restart exited tasks. Exited tasks will be restarted only after the
   client has reestablished communication with servers. System jobs will always
   be restarted. [[GH-5669](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/pull/5669)]

## 0.9.0 (April 9, 2019)

__BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:__

 * core: Drop support for CentOS/RHEL 6. glibc >= 2.14 is required.
 * core: Switch to structured logging using
   [go-hclog](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-hclog). If you have tooling that
   parses Nomad's logs, the format of logs has changed and your tools may need
   updating.
 * core: IOPS as a resource is now deprecated
   [[GH-4970](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/4970)]. Nomad continues
   to parse IOPS in jobs to allow job authors time to remove iops from their
   jobs.
 * core: Allow the != constraint to match against keys that do not exist [[GH-4875](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/pull/4875)]
 * client: Task config validation is more strict in 0.9. For example unknown
   parameters in stanzas under the task config were ignored in previous
   versions but in 0.9 this will cause a task failure.
 * client: Task config interpolation requires names to be valid identifiers
   (`node.region` or `NOMAD_DC`). Interpolating other variables requires a new
   indexing syntax: `env[".invalid.identifier."]`. [[GH-4843](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/4843)]
 * client: Node metadata variables must have valid identifiers, whether
   specified in the config file (`client.meta` stanza) or on the command line
   (`-meta`). [[GH-5158](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/pull/5158)]
 * driver/lxc: The LXC driver is no longer packaged with Nomad and is instead
   distributed separately as a driver plugin. Further, the LXC driver codebase
   is now in a separate
   [repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad-driver-lxc). If you are using
   LXC, please follow the 0.9.0 upgrade guide as you will have to install the
   LXC driver before conducting an in-place upgrade to Nomad 0.9.0 [[GH-5162](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/5162)]

FEATURES:

 * **Affinities and Spread**: Jobs may now specify affinities towards certain
   node attributes. Affinities act as soft constraints, and inform the
   scheduler that the job has a preference for certain node properties. The new
   spread stanza informs the scheduler that allocations should be spread across a
   specific property such as datacenter or availability zone. This is useful to
   increase failure tolerance of critical applications.
 * **System Job Preemption**: System jobs may now preempt lower priority
   allocations. The ability to place system jobs on all targeted nodes is
   critical since system jobs often run applications that provide services for
   all allocations on the node.
 * **Driver Plugins**: Nomad now supports task drivers as plugins. Driver
   plugins operate the same as built-in drivers and can be developed and
   distributed independently from Nomad.
 * **Device Plugins**: Nomad now supports scheduling and mounting devices via
   device plugins. Device plugins expose hardware devices such as GPUs to Nomad
   and instruct the client on how to make them available to tasks. Device
   plugins can expose the health of devices, the devices attributes, and device
   usage statistics. Device plugins can be developed and distributed
   independently from Nomad.
 * **Nvidia GPU Device Plugin**: Nomad builds-in a Nvidia GPU device plugin to
   add out-of-the-box support for scheduling Nvidia GPUs.
 * **Client Refactor**: Major focus has been put in this release to refactor the
   Nomad Client codebase. The goal of the refactor has been to make the
   codebase more modular to increase developer velocity and testability.
 * **Mobile UI Views:** The side-bar navigation, breadcrumbs, and various other page
   elements are now responsively resized and repositioned based on your browser size.
 * **Job Authoring from the UI:** It is now possible to plan and submit new jobs, edit
   existing jobs, stop and start jobs, and promote canaries all from the UI.
 * **Improved Stat Tracking in UI:** The client detail, allocation detail, and task
   detail pages now have line charts that plot CPU and Memory usage changes over time.
 * **Structured Logging**: Nomad now uses structured logging with the ability to
   output logs in a JSON format.

IMPROVEMENTS:

 * core: Added advertise address to client node meta data [[GH-4390](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/4390)]
 * core: Added support for specifying node affinities. Affinities allow job operators to specify weighted placement preferences according to different node attributes [[GH-4512](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/4512)]

## 0.8.0 (April 12, 2018)

__BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:__
 * cli: node drain now blocks until the drain completes and all allocations on
   the draining node have stopped. Use -detach for the old behavior.
 * client: Periods (`.`) are no longer replaced with underscores (`_`) in
   environment variables as many applications rely on periods in environment
   variable names. [[GH-3760](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/3760)]
 * client/metrics: The key emitted for tracking a client's uptime has changed
   from "uptime" to "client.uptime". Users monitoring this metric will have to
   switch to the new key name [[GH-4128](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/4128)]
 * discovery: Prevent absolute URLs in check paths. The documentation indicated
   that absolute URLs are not allowed, but it was not enforced. Absolute URLs
   in HTTP check paths will now fail to validate. [[GH-3685](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/3685)]
 * drain: Draining a node no longer stops all allocations immediately: a new
   [migrate stanza](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/migrate.html)
   allows jobs to specify how quickly task groups can be drained. A `-force`
   option can be used to emulate the old drain behavior.
 * jobspec: The default values for restart policy have changed. Restart policy
   mode defaults to "fail" and the attempts/time interval values have been
   changed to enable faster server side rescheduling. See [restart
   stanza](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/restart.html) for
   more information.
 * jobspec: Removed compatibility code that migrated pre Nomad 0.6.0 Update
   stanza syntax. All job spec files should be using update stanza fields
   introduced in 0.7.0

## 0.7.1 (December 19, 2017)

__BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:__
 * client: The format of service IDs in Consul has changed. If you rely upon

 * config: Nomad no longer parses Atlas configuration stanzas. Atlas has been
   deprecated since earlier this year. If you have an Atlas stanza in your

## 0.3.0 (February 25, 2016)

__BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:__

    update to the new `${NOMAD_ADDR_}` variable [[GH-704](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/704)]
  * Service names that include periods will fail validation. To fix, remove any
    periods from the service name before running the job [[GH-770](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/770)]
  * Task resources are now validated and enforce minimum resources. If a job
    specifies resources below the minimum they will need to be updated [[GH-739](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/739)]

    ID, the node should be drained before Nomad is updated and the data_dir
    should be deleted before starting for the first time [[GH-675](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/675)]
  * Users of custom restart policies should update to the new syntax which adds
    a `mode` field. The `mode` can be either `fail` or `delay`. The default for
    `batch` and `service` jobs is `fail` and `delay` respectively [[GH-594](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/594)]
  * All jobs that interpret variables in constraints or driver configurations
    will need to be updated to the new syntax which wraps the interpreted
    variable in curly braces. (`$node.class` becomes `${node.class}`) [[GH-760](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/760)]
