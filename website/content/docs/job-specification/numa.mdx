# `numa` Block

<Placement groups={['job', 'group', 'task', 'resources', 'numa']} />

The `numa` block is used to configure how Nomad will assign CPU cores for a task
while taking the [NUMA hardware topology][numa_wiki] of a node into consideration.
Workloads that are sensitive to memory latency can perform significantly better
when pinned to CPU cores on the same NUMA node.

<EnterpriseAlert>

This functionality only exists in Nomad Enterprise. This is not
present in the source available version of Nomad.
</EnterpriseAlert>

<Note>

NUMA aware scheduling is currently limited to Linux.
</Note>

```hcl
job "example" {
  group "group" {
    task "task" {
      resources {
        cores = 8
        numa {
          affinity = "require"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In the example above, the task is requesting Nomad to reserve 8 CPU cores, all
of which must be colocated on the same hardware NUMA node. The Nomad scheduler
will ensure the task is placed on a Nomad node with sufficient unused CPU cores
in a compatible configuration.

Configuring the `numa` block requires the task specifies CPU resources using
the [`cores`][cores] parameter.

# `numa` Parameters

- `affinity` `(string: "none")` - Specifies the strategy Nomad will use when
  selecting CPU cores to assign to a task. Possible values are `"none"`,
  `"prefer"`, or `"require"`.
  - `none` - Nomad is free to allocate CPU cores using any strategy. Nomad uses
  this freedom to allocate cores in such a way that minimizes the amount of
  fragmentation of core availability per NUMA node. It does so by bin-packing
  the chosen cores onto the NUMA nodes with the fewest number of cores available.
  - `prefer` - Nomad will select the set of CPU cores on a node that minimizes
  the total distance between those cores, but does not limit those CPU core
  selections to come from a single NUMA node.
  - `require` - Nomad will select a set of CPU cores that are strictly colocated
  on the same hardware NUMA node. If there are no Nomad nodes with a sufficient
  number of available cores in a compatible configuration, task placement will
  fail due to exhausted resources.

- `devices` `(list<string>: nil)` - Specifies which devices must be colocated on
  the name NUMA node, along with allocated CPU cores. Must be a subset of the
  devices listed in the [resources] block. May only be used with `affinity` set
  to `require`.

<Note>

  The `require` affinity option causes fragmentation of available CPU cores
  based on the NUMA node the selected cores are associated with. Use it for
  workloads known to be highly sensitive to memory latencies. A cluster where
  all jobs make use of the `require` affinity option will not be able to make
  efficient use of available resources.
</Note>

## `numa` Examples

This example will allocate a `1080ti` GPU and ensure it is on the same NUMA node
as the 4 CPU cores reserved for the task.

```hcl
resources {
  cores  = 4
  memory = 2048

  device "nvidia/gpu/1080ti" {
    count = 1
  }

  numa {
    affinity = "require"
    devices = [
      "nvidia/gpu/1080ti"
    ]
  }
}
```
