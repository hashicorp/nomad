# Getting Started with Nomad

To get started, we can use this guide to manually provision a Nomad cluster 
step-by-step or we can use [Nomad's example Terraform configuration](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/terraform) to automatically provision a cluster in AWS. The 
steps in this guide will be useful as a reference even if we choose the latter 
option.

## Next Steps

To manually provision a cluster, proceed to 
[Install Nomad](/intro/getting-started/install.html). To automatically provision
 a cluster in AWS, click [here](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/terraform).
