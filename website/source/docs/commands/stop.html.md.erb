# Command: stop

The `stop` command is used to stop a running job and signals the scheduler
to cancel all of the running allocations.

## Usage

```
nomad stop [options] <job>
```

The stop command requires a single argument, specifying the job ID to
cancel.

Upon successful deregistraion, an interactive monitor session will start to
display log lines as the job unwinds its allocations and completes shutting
down. The monitor will exit once all allocations are stopped and the job has
reached a terminal state. It is safe to exit the monitor early using ctrl+c.

## General Options

<%= general_options_usage %>

## Stop Options

* `-detach`: Return immediately instead of monitoring. A new evaluation ID
  will be output, which can be used to call the monitor later using the
  [eval-monitor](/docs/commands/eval-monitor.html) command.

## Examples

Run a new job and monitor placement:

```
$ nomad run job1.job
==> Monitoring evaluation "ffd1d625-c208-bf36-ac34-17f3191a7b57"
    2015/09/17 23:02:14 Allocation "020a32d1-e3a8-b67e-f41a-1a49853b472a" created: node "dd522226-6f0b-6ecd-1ae1-17670e448985", group "group1"
    2015/09/17 23:02:14 Evaluation status changed: "" -> "pending"
    2015/09/17 23:02:15 Allocation "020a32d1-e3a8-b67e-f41a-1a49853b472a" status changed: "pending" -> "running"
    2015/09/17 23:02:15 Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "ffd1d625-c208-bf36-ac34-17f3191a7b57" finished with status "complete"
```

Run a new job and return immediately:

```
$ nomad run -detach job1.job

```
