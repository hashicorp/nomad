# Virt task driver plugin

Name: `virt`

The Virt task driver utilizes the [libvirt][] API to run and manage virtual
machines using hypervisors such as [QEMU][]. The task driver supports a wide
variety of Nomad features including [workload identity][], [task templates][],
and [service discovery][].

@include 'virt-beta-callout.mdx'

## Driver Capabilities

The Virt task driver implements these driver [capabilities][capabilities].

| Feature              | Implementation |
|----------------------|----------------|
| `nomad alloc signal` | false          |
| `nomad alloc exec`   | false          |
| filesystem isolation | image          |
| network isolation    | host           |
| volume mounting      | false          |

## Nomad Client Node Attributes

The Virt task driver provides these node attributes that you can use as
constraints when authoring jobs.

```
driver.virt                              = true
driver.virt.active                       = 0
driver.virt.emulator.version             = 8002002
driver.virt.inactive                     = 0bytes
driver.virt.libvirt.version              = 10000000
driver.virt.network.default.bridge_name  = virbr0
driver.virt.network.default.state        = active
```
