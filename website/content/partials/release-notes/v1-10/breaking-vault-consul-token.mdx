#### Vault and Consul integration changes

Nomad 1.10.0 removes the previously deprecated token-based authentication
workflow for Vault and Consul. Nomad clients must now use a task's [workload
identity](/nomad/docs/concepts/workload-identity) to authenticate to Vault and
Consul and obtain a token specific to the task.

This table lists removed Vault fields and the new workflow.

| Field | Configuration | New Workflow |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| [`vault.allow_unauthenticated`](/nomad/docs/v1.8.x/configuration/vault#allow_unauthenticated) | Agent | Tasks should use a workload identity. Do not use a Vault token. |
| [`vault.task_token_ttl`]( /nomad/docs/v1.8.x/configuration/vault#task_token_ttl) | Agent | With workload identity, tasks receive their TTL configuration from the Vault role. |
| [`vault.token`](/nomad/docs/v1.8.x/configuration/vault#token) | Agent | Nomad agents use the workload identity when making requests to authenticated endpoints. |
| [`vault.policies`](/nomad/docs/v1.8.x/job-specification/vault#policies) | Job specification  |  Configure and use a Vault role.  |

Before upgrading to Nomad 1.10, perform the following tasks:

1. Configure Vault and Consul to work with workload identity.
1. Migrate all workloads to use workload identity.

Refer to the following guides for more information:
