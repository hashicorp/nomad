# Network plugins

Nomad has built-in support for scheduling compute resources such as
CPU, memory, and networking. Nomad's network plugin support extends
this to allow scheduling tasks with externally created storage
volumes. Network plugins are third-party plugins that conform to the
[Container Network Interface (CNI)][cni_spec] specification.

Network plugins need to be installed and configured on each client. The Nomad
installation instructions recommend installing the [CNI reference plugins][cni_ref]
because certain Nomad networking features, like `bridge` network mode and
Consul service mesh, leverage them to provide an operating-system agnostic
interface to configure workload networking.

Custom networking in Nomad is accomplished with a combination of CNI plugin
binaries and CNI configuration files.

## CNI plugins

As part of installing Consul service mesh support for Nomad, you will have
installed the [CNI reference plugins][cni_ref]. There is also a
[list of available third-party CNI plugins][3rd_party_cni], which can be found
on the CNI.dev website. Spec-compliant plugins should work with Nomad.
However, it's possible a plugin vendor has implemented their plugin to make
non-standard API calls, or it is otherwise non-compliant with the CNI
specification. In those situations the plugin may not function correctly in a
Nomad environment. You should verify plugin compatibility with Nomad before
deploying in production.

CNI plugins are installed and configured on a per-client basis. Nomad consults
the path given in the client's [`cni_path`][] to find CNI plugin executables.

## CNI configuration files

CNI defines a network configuration format for administrators. It contains
directives for both the orchestrator and the plugins to consume.
At plugin execution time, this configuration format is interpreted by the
runtime and transformed in to a form to be passed to the plugins.

Nomad reads all files with a `.conflist` extension in the [`cni_config_dir`][]â€”
`/opt/cni/config` by default.

## Further reading

You can read more about how Nomad uses CNI plugins in the [CNI section of the
Nomad Networking documentation](/docs/networking/cni).
