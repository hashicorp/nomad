# Resource Utilization

Understanding the resource utilization of an application is important, and Nomad
supports reporting detailed statistics in many of its drivers. The main
interface for seeing resource utilization is the `alloc status` command with the
`-stats` flag.

This section will utilize the job named "docs" from the [previous
sections](/guides/operating-a-job/submitting-jobs), but these operations
and command largely apply to all jobs in Nomad.

As a reminder, here is the output of the run command from the previous example:

```shell
$ nomad job run docs.nomad
==> Monitoring evaluation "42d788a3"
    Evaluation triggered by job "docs"
    Allocation "04d9627d" created: node "a1f934c9", group "example"
    Allocation "e7b8d4f5" created: node "012ea79b", group "example"
    Allocation "5cbf23a1" modified: node "1e1aa1e0", group "example"
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "42d788a3" finished with status "complete"
```

To see the detailed usage statistics, we can issue the command:

```shell
$ nomad alloc status -stats 04d9627d
ID            = 04d9627d
Eval ID       = 42d788a3
Name          = docs.example[2]
Node ID       = a1f934c9
Job ID        = docs
Client Status = running

Task "server" is "running"

```

Here we can see that we are near the limit of our configured CPU but we have
plenty of memory headroom. We can use this information to alter our job's
resources to better reflect its actual needs:

```hcl
resources {
  cpu    = 200
  memory = 10
}
```

Adjusting resources is very important for a variety of reasons:

- Ensuring your application does not get OOM killed if it hits its memory limit.
- Ensuring the application performs well by ensuring it has some CPU allowance.
- Optimizing cluster density by reserving what you need and not over-allocating.

While single point in time resource usage measurements are useful, it is often
more useful to graph resource usage over time to better understand and estimate
resource usage. Nomad supports outputting resource data to statsite and statsd
and is the recommended way of monitoring resources. For more information about
outputting telemetry see the [Telemetry Guide](/docs/telemetry).

For more advanced use cases, the resource usage data is also accessible via the
client's HTTP API. See the documentation of the Client's [allocation HTTP
API](/api/client).
