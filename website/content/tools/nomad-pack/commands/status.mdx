# nomad-pack status command reference

Use the `nomad-pack status` command to fetch information on deployed Nomad packs.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad-pack status <pack_name> [options]
```

If you do not specify a pack name, the `nomad-pack status` command returns	a
list of all deployed packs. If you do specify a pack name, this command returns
a list of all deployed jobs belonging to that pack, along with their status and
deployment names.

## Options

- `-registry=<string>`: Specific registry name containing the pack to inspect.If
  not specified, the command uses the default registry.
- `-ref=<string>`: Specific Git reference of the pack to retrieve info about.
  Supports tags, SHA, and `@latest`. If you do not specify a reference, the
  value defaults to `@latest`. Using `ref` with a file path is not supported.
