# Install Nomad in a production environment

While HashiCorp Nomad provides a low-friction practitioner experience out of
the box, there are a few critical steps to take for a successful production
Nomad deployment.

## Explore the reference architecture and installation guide

Learn more about recommended practices and explore a reference architecture for
deploying HashiCorp Nomad in production.
