# Node Identity
This page provides conceptual information about Nomad's node identity feature, which uniquely
identities each Nomad client node and provides an authentication mechanism for nodes to make RPC
calls to the Nomad servers.

Every Nomad node is given a default identity once the cluster is able to fully support the feature
with a defined lifetime. This node identity is a [JSON Web Token (JWT)][] that has been signed by
the leader's keyring and is generated as part of the node's registration and heartbeat process.

## Node Identity Claims

Nomad node identity includes the following identity claims alongside the standard JWT claims such as
`exp` (expiration time), `iat` (issued at time), and `aud` (audience).

```json
{
  "nomad_node_id": "f6e8c9d4-5b6a-4c3d-8e2f-1a2b3c4d5e6f",
  "nomad_node_pool": "default",
  "nomad_node_datacenter": "dc1"
}
```

To view all identity claims for a specific node, operators can run the
[`node identity get` command][cli_node_identity_get].

## Node Identity Renewal
A node's identity expiration is dictated by the [`node_identity_ttl`][config_node_identity_ttl]
parameter within the node pool speficication, which defaults to 24 hours. When a node's identity has
exceeded 67% of its lifetime, the Nomad server will issue a new identity to the node at its next
heartbeat.

Operators can force a node to renew its identity at its next heartbeat by running the
[`node identity renew` command][cli_node_identity_renew] which ensure the 67% lifetime check is
bypassed.
