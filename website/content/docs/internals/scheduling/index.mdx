# Scheduling

Scheduling is a core function of Nomad. It is the process of assigning tasks
from jobs to client machines. The design is heavily inspired by Google's work on
both [Omega: flexible, scalable schedulers for large compute clusters][omega] and
[Large-scale cluster management at Google with Borg][borg]. See the links below
for implementation details on scheduling in Nomad.
