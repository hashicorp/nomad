# `target` Block

<Placement groups={['target']} />

The `target` block is used to configure scaling target plugins.

```hcl
target "example-target-plugin" {
  driver = "example-target-plugin"
  args   = ["-my-flag"]

  config = {
    region = "esp-vlc-1"
  }
}
```

## `target` Parameters

- `args` `(array<string>: [])` - Specifies a set of arguments to pass to the
  plugin binary when it is executed.

- `driver` `(string: "")` - The plugin's executable name relative to the
  [`plugin_dir`][plugin_dir]. If the plugin has a suffix, such as .exe, this
  should be omitted.

- `config` `(map<string><string>: nil)` - Specifies configuration values for
  the plugin either as HCL or JSON. The accepted values are plugin specific.
  Please refer to the individual plugin's documentation.
