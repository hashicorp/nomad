# `nomad eval status` command reference

The `eval status` command is used to display information about an existing
evaluation. In the case an evaluation could not place all the requested
allocations, this command can be used to determine the failure reasons.

Optionally, it can also be invoked in a monitor mode to track an outstanding
evaluation. In this mode, logs will be output describing state changes to the
evaluation or its associated allocations. The monitor will exit when the
evaluation reaches a terminal state.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad eval status [options] <evaluation>
```

An evaluation ID or prefix must be provided. If there is an exact match, the
the status will be shown. Otherwise, a list of matching evaluations and
information will be displayed.

If the `-monitor` flag is passed, an interactive monitoring session will be
started in the terminal. It is safe to exit the monitor at any time using
ctrl+c. The command will exit when the given evaluation reaches a terminal
state (completed or failed). Exit code 0 is returned on successful
evaluation, and if there are no scheduling problems. If there are
job placement issues encountered (unsatisfiable constraints,
resource exhaustion, etc), then the exit code will be 2. Any other
errors, including client connection issues or internal errors, are
indicated by exit code 1.

## Options

- `-monitor`: Monitor an outstanding evaluation
- `-verbose`: Show full-length IDs and exact timestamps.
- `-json`: Output the evaluation in its JSON format. This format will not
    include placed allocations.
- `-t` : Format and display evaluation using a Go template. This format will not
  include placed allocations.
- `-ui`: Open the evaluation in the browser.

## Examples

Show the status of an evaluation with related evaluations, successful
placements, failed placements, and preemptions.

Monitor an existing evaluation

```shell-session
$ nomad eval status -monitor 8262bc83
==> Monitoring evaluation "8262bc83"
    Allocation "bd6bd0de" created: node "6f299da5", group "group1"
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "8262bc83" finished with status "complete"
```
