# Nomad volume specification capability block

<Placement
  groups={[
    ['volume', 'capability'],
  ]}
/>

The `capability` block allows validating that a volume meets the requested
capabilities.

```hcl
id           = "ebs_prod_db1"
namespace    = "default"
name         = "database"
type         = "csi"
plugin_id    = "ebs-prod"
capacity_max = "200G"
capacity_min = "100G"

capability {
  access_mode     = "single-node-reader-only"
  attachment_mode = "file-system"
}
```

You must provide at least one `capability` block, and you must provide a block
for each capability you intend to use in a job's [`volume`] block.

## Parameters

- `access_mode` `(string)` - Defines whether a volume should be available
  concurrently. The `access_mode` and `attachment_mode` from the volume request
  must exactly match one of the volume's `capability` blocks.

  - For CSI volumes the `access_mode` is required. Can be one of the following:

    - `"single-node-reader-only"`: Jobs can only request the volume with
      read-only access, and only one node can mount the volume at a time.
    - `"single-node-writer"`: Jobs can request the volume with read/write or
      read-only access, and only one node can mount the volume at a time.
    - `"multi-node-reader-only"`: Jobs can only request the volume with
      read-only access, but multiple nodes can mount the volume simultaneously.
    - `"multi-node-single-writer"`: Jobs can request the volume with read/write
      or read-only access, but the scheduler only allows one allocation to have
      read/write access. Multiple nodes can mount the volume simultaneously.
    - `"multi-node-multi-writer"`: Jobs can request the volume with read/write
      or read-only access, and the scheduler allows multiple allocations to have
      read/write access. Multiple nodes can mount the volume simultaneously.

    Most CSI plugins support only single-node modes. Consult the documentation
    of the storage provider and CSI plugin.

  - For dynamic host volumes the `access_mode` is optional. Can be one of the following:

    - `"single-node-writer"`: Jobs can only request the volume with read/write access.
    - `"single-node-reader-only"`: Jobs can only request the volume with read-only access.
    - `"single-node-single-writer"`: Jobs can request either read/write or
      read-only access, but the scheduler only allows one allocation to have
      read/write access.
    - `"single-node-multi-writer"`: Jobs can request either read/write or
      read-only access, and the scheduler allows multiple allocations to have
      read/write access.

    In the job specification, the default is `single-node-writer` unless
    `read_only = true`, which translates to `single-node-reader-only`.

- `attachment_mode` `(string)` - The storage API used by the volume. One of
  `"file-system"` or `"block-device"`. The `access_mode` and `attachment_mode`
  from the volume request must exactly match one of the volume's `capability`
  blocks.

  - For CSI volumes the `attachment_mode` field is required. Most storage
    providers support `"file-system"`, to mount volumes using the CSI
    filesystem API. Some storage providers support `"block-device"`, which
    mounts the volume with the CSI block device API within the container.

  - For dynamic host volumes the `attachment_mode` field is optional and
    defaults to `"file-system"`.

## Example

This examples shows a volume that must satisfy multiple capability
requirements.

```hcl
capability {
  access_mode     = "single-node-reader-only"
  attachment_mode = "file-system"
}

capability {
  access_mode     = "single-node-writer"
  attachment_mode = "file-system"
}
```
