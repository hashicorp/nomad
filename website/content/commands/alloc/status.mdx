# `nomad alloc status` command reference

The `alloc status` command displays status information and metadata
about an existing allocation and its tasks. It can be useful while
debugging to reveal the underlying reasons for scheduling decisions or
failures, as well as the current state of its tasks.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad alloc status [options] <allocation>
```

An allocation ID or prefix must be provided. If there is an exact match, the
full details of the allocation will be displayed. Otherwise, a list of matching
allocations and information will be displayed.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the `read-job` and
`list-jobs` capabilities for the allocation's namespace.

## Options

- `-short`: Display short output. Shows only the most recent task event.
- `-verbose`: Show full-length IDs, exact timestamps, and placement metrics.
- `-json` : Output the allocation in its JSON format.
- `-t` : Format and display the allocation using a Go template.
- `-ui` : Open the allocation status page in the browser.

## Examples

Short status of an alloc:

```shell-session
$ nomad alloc status --short 0af996ed
ID                  = 0af996ed
Eval ID             = be9bde98
Name                = example.cache[0]
Node ID             = 43c0b14e
Job ID              = example
Job Version         = 0
Client Status       = running
Client Description  = <none>
Desired Status      = run
Desired Description = <none>
Created At          = 07/25/17 16:12:48 UTC
Deployment ID       = 0c83a3b1
Deployment Health   = healthy

Tasks
Name   State    Last Event  Time
redis  running  Started     07/25/17 16:12:48 UTC
web    running  Started     07/25/17 16:12:49 UTC
```

Full status of an alloc, which shows one of the tasks dying and then being restarted:

```shell-session

The `-verbose` flag includes information about the scheduler's placement
decision, including the number of nodes evaluated and rejected, and the scoring
of each node considered.
