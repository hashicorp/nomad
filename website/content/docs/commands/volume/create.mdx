  Create volumes with CSI plugins.

# Command: volume create

The `volume create` command creates external storage volumes with Nomad's
[Container Storage Interface (CSI)][csi] support. Only CSI plugins that
implement the [Controller][csi_plugins_internals] interface support this
command. The volume will also be [registered] when it is successfully created.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad volume create [options] [file]
```

The `volume create` command requires a single argument, specifying the path to
a file containing a valid [volume specification][volume_specification]. This
file will be read and the volume will be submitted to Nomad for scheduling. If
the supplied path is "-", the volume file is read from STDIN. Otherwise it is
read from the file at the supplied path.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the
`csi-write-volume` capability for the volume's namespace.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Volume Specification

The file may be provided as either HCL or JSON. An example HCL configuration:

```hcl
id           = "ebs_prod_db1"
name         = "database"
type         = "csi"
plugin_id    = "ebs-prod"
snapshot_id  = "snap-12345" # or clone_id, see below
capacity_max = "200G"
capacity_min = "100G"

capability {
  access_mode     = "single-node-reader-only"
  attachment_mode = "file-system"
}

capability {
  access_mode     = "single-node-writer"
  attachment_mode = "file-system"
}

mount_options {
  fs_type     = "ext4"
  mount_flags = "noatime"
}

secrets {
  example_secret = "xyzzy"
}

parameters {
  skuname = "Premium_LRS"
}
```

## Volume Specification Parameters

- `id` `(string: <required>)` - The unique ID of the volume. This is how the
  [`volume.source`][csi_volume_source] field in a job specification will refer
  to the volume.

- `name` `(string: <required>)` - The display name of the volume. This field
  may be used by the external storage provider to tag the volume.

- `type` `(string: <required>)` - The type of volume. Currently only `"csi"`
  is supported.

- `plugin_id` `(string: <required>)` - The ID of the [CSI plugin][csi_plugin]
  that manages this volume.

- `snapshot_id` `(string: <optional>)` - If the storage provider supports
  snapshots, the external ID of the snapshot to restore when creating this
  volume. If omitted, the volume will be created from scratch. The
  `snapshot_id` cannot be set if the `clone_id` field is set.

- `clone_id` `(string: <optional>)` - If the storage provider supports
  cloning, the external ID of the volume to clone when creating this
  volume. If omitted, the volume will be created from scratch. The
  `clone_id` cannot be set if the `snapshot_id` field is set.

- `capacity_min` `(string: <optional>)` - Option for setting the capacity. The
  volume must be at least this large, in bytes. The storage provider may
  return a volume that is larger than this value. Accepts human-friendly
  suffixes such as `"100GiB"`. This field may not be supported by all
  storage providers.

- `capacity_max` `(string: <optional>)` - Option for setting the capacity. The
  volume must be no more than this large, in bytes. The storage provider may
  return a volume that is smaller than this value. Accepts human-friendly
  suffixes such as `"100GiB"`. This field may not be supported by all
  storage providers.

- `capability` `(Capability: <required>)` - Option for validating the
  capbility of a volume. You must provide at least one `capability` block, and
  you must provide a block for each capability you intend to use in a job's
  [`volume`] block. Each `capability` block must have the following fields:

  - `access_mode` `(string: <required>)` - Defines whether a volume should be
    available concurrently. Can be one of `"single-node-reader-only"`,
    `"single-node-writer"`, `"multi-node-reader-only"`,
    `"multi-node-single-writer"`, or `"multi-node-multi-writer"`. Most CSI
    plugins support only single-node modes. Consult the documentation of the
    storage provider and CSI plugin.

  - `attachment_mode` `(string: <required>)` - The storage API that will be used
    by the volume. Most storage providers will support `"file-system"`, to mount
    volumes using the CSI filesystem API. Some storage providers will support
    `"block-device"`, which will mount the volume with the CSI block device API
    within the container.

- `mount_options` - Options for mounting `file-system` volumes that don't
  already have a pre-formatted file system. This block will be validated
  during volume creation against the `capability` field. The `mount_options`
  provided in a job specification's [`volume`] block will override this
  block. Consult the documentation for your storage provider and CSI plugin as
  to whether these options are required or necessary.

  - `fs_type` `(string <optional>)` - File system type (ex. `"ext4"`)
  - `mount_flags` `([]string: <optional>)` - The flags passed to `mount`
    (ex. `["ro", "noatime"]`)

- `secrets` <code>(map<string|string>:nil)</code> - An optional
  key-value map of strings used as credentials for publishing and
  unpublishing volumes.

- `parameters` <code>(map<string|string>:nil)</code> - An optional
  key-value map of strings passed directly to the CSI plugin to
  configure the volume. The details of these parameters are specific
  to each storage provider, so please see the specific plugin
  documentation for more information.

### Unused Fields

Note that several fields used in the [`volume register`] command are set
automatically by the plugin when `volume create` is successful. You should not
set the `external_id` or `context` fields described on that page.
