description: |-
  Learn about persistent storage options for stateful workloads on Nomad.
---
By default, HashiCorp Nomad's allocation storage is ephemeral. Nomad can discard it during new deployments, when rescheduling jobs, or if it loses a client. This is undesirable when running persistent workloads such as databases.

This document explores the options for persistent storage of workloads running in Nomad. The information provided is for practitioners familiar with Nomad and with a foundational understanding of storage basics. 

At the end of this article, we provide a [storage comparison](#storage-comparison) table with the advantages, disadvantages, and the ideal use-case for each storage option. This guidance will help you understand and choose the best storage option for your Nomad allocation storage.

This document addresses traditional storage you can attach as a filesystem and does not cover object storage such as AWS S3 or MinIO. 

## Considerations

Consider access patterns, performance, reliability and availability needs, and maintenance to choose the most appropriate storage strategy. 

Local storage is performant and available. If it has enough capacity it does not need much maintenance. But, it is not redundant; if a single node, disk, or group of disks fails, data loss and service interruption will occur.

A geographically distributed networked storage with multiple redundancies, including disks, controllers, and network paths, provides higher availability and resilience, and can tolerate multiple hardware failures before risking data loss. But, it relies on network performance, can have higher latency, be lower-throughput, and need more maintenance.

Consider whether Nomad is running in the public cloud or on-premises, and what storage options are available in that environment. From there, the most optimal choice will depend your organizational and application needs.

### Public cloud

Public cloud providers offer different storage services with various tradeoffs. Usually they're comprised of local disks (physically attached and very performant, but not very persistent), network attacked block devices (performant and very persistent, but usually only attachable to one instance at a time), and networked shared storage (less performant, but can be accessed from multiple instances).

### Private cloud or on-premises

When running workloads on-premises in a self-managed private cloud, SAN/NAS systems or Software Defined Storage like Portworx or Ceph are usually used to provision non-local storage. Compute instances can access the storage using a block protocol such as iSCSI, FC, NVMe-oF, or a file protocol such as NFS, CIFS, or sometimes both. Dedicated storage teams manage these systems in most organizations.

## Persistent storage options

Since environments differ depending on application requirements, consider performance, reliability, availability, and maintenance when choosing the most appropriate storage option.

### CSI

[Container Storage Interface](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec) is a vendor-neutral specification that allows storage providers to develop plugins that orchestrators such as Nomad can use. Some CSI plugins can dynamically provision and manage volume lifecycles, including snapshots, deletion, and dynamic resizing. The exact feature set each plugin supports will depend on the plugin and the underlying storage platform.  

Find a list of plugins and their feature set in the [Kubernetes CSI Developer Documentation](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/drivers.html).

While Nomad follows the CSI specification, some plugins may implement orchestrator-specific logic that makes them incompatible with Nomad. You should validate that your chosen plugin works with Nomad before using it. Refer to the plugin documentation from the storage provider for more information.

There are three CSI plugin subtypes:

- **Controller**: Communicates with the storage provider to manage the volume lifecycle.
	- **Node**: Runs on all Nomad clients and handles all local operations (for example, mounting/unmounting volumes in allocations). The node must be `privileged` to perform those operations.
	- **Monolithic**: Combines both the above roles.

All types can and should be run as Nomad jobs - `system` jobs for Node and Monolithic, `service` for Controllers.

CSI plugins are useful when storage requirements are quickly and constantly evolving due to their dynamic nature - for instance new workloads needing persistent strage being added or removed frequently, but they present some challenges in terms of maintenance. Most notably, they need to run constantly, be configured (including authentication and connectivity to the storage platform), and updated to keep track with new features and bug fixes and keep compatibility with the underlying storage platform.

The [Stateful Workloads with CSI tutorial](/nomad/tutorials/stateful-workloads/stateful-workloads-csi-volumes) and the [Nomad CSI demo repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/tree/main/demo/csi) offer guidance and examples on how to use CSI plugins with Nomad and include job files for running the plugins and configuration files for creating and consuming volumes.

### Host volumes

Host volumes mount paths from the host (the Nomad client) into allocations. Nomad is aware host volume availability and uses it for job scheduling. But, Nomad does not know about the volume's underlying characteristics, such as if it is a standard folder on a local ext4 filesystem, backed by a distributed networked storage such as GlusterFS, or a mounted NFS/CIFS volume from a NAS or a public cloud service such as AWS EFS. Because you need to declare host volumes in the agent configuration file, you have to restart the Nomad client to reconfigure them. This makes host volumes impractical if you need to change your storage configuration frequently. 

As administrators usually handle storage, operating system (OS), and job configurations separately, make sure that appropriate access controls grant permission to modify and update these configurations. If there is a complete separation of duties for storage, OS, and job management, the different teams must communicate well to mitigate potential issues around storage performance, size limitations, and inappropriate mounting options.

Host volumes backed by local storage help persist data that is not critical, for example an on-disk cache that you can rebuild you need to. When backed by networked storage such as NFS/CIFS-mounted volumes or distributed storage via GlusterFS/Ceph, host volumes provide a quick option to consume highly available and reliable storage.

Refer to the [Stateful workloads with Nomad host volumes](/nomad/tutorials/stateful-workloads/stateful-workloads-host-volumes) tutorial to learn more about using host volumes with Nomad.

#### NFS caveats

A few caveats to note with NFS-backed host volumes include ACLs, reliability, and performance. NFS mount options should be the same on all mounting Nomad clients.

A significant factor in the performance of NFS-backed storage is the `wsize` and `rsize` mount options that determine the maximum read/write size of a block. Smaller sizes mean bigger operations will be split into smaller chunks, significantly impacting performance. The underlying storage system's vendor provides the optimal sizes. For example, [AWS EFS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/mounting-fs-mount-cmd-general.html) recommends a value of `1048576` bytes of data for both `wsize` and `rsize`.

Depending on your NFS version, the UID/GID (user/group IDs) can differ between the different Nomad clients, leading to issues when an allocation on another host tries to access the volume. The only way to ensure this isn't an issue is to use NFS v4 with ID mapping based on Kerberos or to have a reliable configuration management/image-building process that ensures UID/GIDs synchronize between hosts. You should use hard mounts to prevent data loss, optionally with `intr` to enable the option to interrupt NFS requests, which prevents the whole system from locking up in case of NFS server unavailability. 

To learn more about hard mounts and soft mounts, visit Red Hat's [NFS documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/5/html/deployment_guide/s1-nfs-client-config-options).

### Ephemeral disks

Nomad [ephemeral disks](/nomad/docs/job-specification/ephemeral_disk), describe the best-effort persistence of a Nomad allocation's folder. They support data migrations between hosts (which require network connectivity between the Nomad client nodes) and are size-aware for scheduling. Since persistence is the best effort, however,  you will lose data if the client or underlying storage fails. Ephemeral disks are perfect for data that you can rebuild if needed, such as an in-progress cache or a local copy of data.
