```release-note:bug
server: Added a new server configuration option named `start_timeout` with a default value of `30s`. This duration is used to monitor the server setup and startup processes which must complete before it is considered healthy, such as keyring decryption. If these processes do not complete before the timeout is reached, the server process will exit.
```
