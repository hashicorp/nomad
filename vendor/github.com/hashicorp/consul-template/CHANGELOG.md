## v0.21.0 (August 05, 2019)

IMPROVEMENTS:

* Migrated to use Go modules [[GH-1244](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template/pull/1244), [GH-1173](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template/issues/1173), [GH-1208](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template/pull/1208)[GH-1232](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template/pull/1232)]
* Template blacklist feature [[GH-1243](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template/pull/1243)]

## v0.20.1 (July 30, 2019)

BUG FIXES:

* Fixed issue with exec running before template rendering when wait is set [[GH-1229](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template/issues/1229), [GH-1209](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template/issues/1209)]
* Fixed issue with templates not rendering with `-once` [[GH-1227](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template/pull/1227), [GH-1196](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template/issues/1196), [GH-1207](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template/issues/1207)]
* Fixed regression with ~/.vault-token and with vault_agent_token_file not respecting renew_token [[GH-1228](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template/issues/1228), [GH-1189](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template/issues/1189)]
* CA certificates missing from docker 'light' image [[GH-1200](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template/issues/1200)]
* Fixed issue with dedup data garbage in Consul KV [[GH-1158](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template/issues/1158), [[GH-1168](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template/issues/1168)]
* Fixed bad case in import path [[GH-1139](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template/issues/1139)]
* Documented limits on using "." in service names [[GH-1205](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template/issues/1205)]

## v0.20.0 (February 19, 2019)

IMPROVEMENTS:

* Support for Consul service metadata [GH-1113]
* Support for Vault's KV v2 secrets engine, including versioned secrets [GH-1180].
* Support for Vault Enterprise's namespaces feature [GH-1181].
* Support for a new config parameter, `vault_agent_token_file`, which supports loading the Vault token from the contents of a dynamically updated file. This is intended for use in environments like Kubernetes [GH-1185].
* A template's destination file will now have its user and group permissions preserved on supported OSes (Linux/MacOS) [GH-1061].

BUG FIXES:

* The indent function no longer panics on negative spaces variable [GH-1127]
* Fixed an issue that caused `exec` to not be called with multiple templates and `wait` configured [GH-1043]
* Fixed an issue where Consul Template did not wait for most of a non-renewable secret's lease before attempting to refresh the secret. [GH-1183]
 
## v0.19.5 (June 12, 2018)

BUG FIXES:

  * The de-duplication feature was incorrectly calculating the hash of dependency 
    values over an unstable encoding of the data. This meant that in most cases 
    the templates were being re-written to KV and on all watching template 
    instances every minimum update time (i.e. `wait { min = X }`). At best this
    was a lot of wasted work, in some cases it caused 100% CPU usage when template 
    instance leadership was split. [GH-1099, GH-1095]
  * Fixed an issue where we waited unnecessarily for a child process to exit [GH-1101]

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Initiating runner log level moved to DEBUG [GH-1088]


## v0.19.4 (October 30, 2017)

BREAKING CHANGES:

  * The version of Consul Template is now taken into account when using
    de-duplication mode. Without bundling the version, it's challenging to
    upgrade existing clusters or run multiple versions of Consul Template on the
    same cluster and template simultaneously. [GH-1025]

BUG FIXES:

  * Remove references to unsupported `dump_signal` configuration

  * Update vendor libraries to support Consul 1.0.0 changes for better test
    stability

  * Renew unwrapped Vault token (previously Consul Template) would try to renew
    the wrapped token, which would not work.

  * Do not sort results when `~near` queries are used [GH-1027]

  * Handle integer overflow in exponential backoff calculations
    [GH-1031, GH-1028]

  * Properly preserve existing file permissions [GH-1037]

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Compile with Go 1.9.2

  * The Vault grace period in the config is now set to 15 seconds as the
    default. This matches Vault's default configuration for consistency.

  * Add `indent` function for indenting blocks of text in templates

  * Allow additional colons in the template command on the CLI [GH-1026]

  * Add Vault Transit example for key exfiltration [GH-1014]

  * Add a new option for disabling recursive directory creation per template
    [GH-1033]

  * Allow dots in node names [GH-977]

## v0.19.3 (September 11, 2017)

BUG FIXES:

  * Fix a bug that would cause once mode to not exit when the file pre-existed
    on disk with the correct contents. [GH-1000]

## v0.19.2 (September 1, 2017)

BUG FIXES:

  * Fix a critical bug that would cause a hot loop for some TTL durations.
      [GH-1004]

## v0.19.1 (August 25, 2017)

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * The runner's render event now includes the last-rendered template contents.
      This is useful when embedding Consul Template as a library. [GH-974-975]

  * Use the new Golang API renewer [GH-978]

  * Compile and build with Go 1.9

BUG FIXES:

  * Add per-template option `error_on_missing_key`. This causes the template to
      error when the user attempts to access a key in a map or field in a struct
      that does not exist. Previous behavior was to print `<no value>`, which
      might not be the desired behavior. This is opt-in behavior on a
      per-template basis. There is no global option. A future version of
      Consul Template will switch the default behavior to this safer format, but
      that change will be clearly called out as a breaking change in the future.
      Users should set `error_on_missing_key = false` in their configuration
      files if they are relying on the current `<no value>` behavior.
      [GH-973, GH-972]
  * Ensure all templates are rendered before spawning commands [GH-991, GH-995]

## v0.19.0 (June 29, 2017)

BREAKING CHANGES:

  * All previous deprecation errors have been removed and associated configs or
      CLI options are no longer valid. It is highly recommended that you run
      v0.18.5 and resolve any deprecations before upgrading to this version!

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Add new configuration option `vault.grace`, which configures the grace
      period between lease renewal and secret re-acquisition. When renewing a
      secret, if the remaining lease is less than or equal to the configured
      grace, Consul Template will request a new credential. This prevents Vault
      from revoking the credential at expiration and Consul Template having a
      stale credential. **If you set this to a value that is higher than your
      default TTL or max TTL, Consul Template will always read a new secret!**
  * Add a new option to `datacenters` to optionally ignore inaccessible
      datacenters [GH-908].

BUG FIXES:

  * Use the logger as soon as its available for output [GH-947]
  * Update Consul API library to fix a bug where custom CA configuration was
      ignored [GH-965]


## v0.18.5 (May 25, 2017)

BREAKING CHANGES:

  * Retry now has a sane maximum default. Previous versions of Consul Template
      would retry indefinitely, potentially allowing the time between retries to
      reach days, months, or years due to the exponential nature. Users wishing
      to use the old behavior should set `max_backoff = 0` in their
      configurations. [GH-940]

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Add support for `MaxBackoff` in Retry options [GH-938, GH-939]
  * Compile with Go 1.8.3

## v0.18.4 (May 25, 2017)

BUG FIXES:

  * Compile with go 1.8.2 for the security fix. The code is exactly the same as
      v0.18.3.

## v0.18.3 (May 9, 2017)

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Add support for local datacenter in node queries [GH-862, GH-927]
  * Add support for service tags on health checks [Consul vendor update]

BUG FIXES:

  * Seed the random generator for splay values  
  * Reset retries counter on successful contact [GH-931]
  * Return a nil slice instead of an error for non-existent maps
      [GH-906, GH-932]
  * Do not return data in dedup mode if the template is unchanged
      [GH-933 GH-698]

NOTABLE:

  * Consul Template is now built with Go 1.8.1
  * Update internal library to Consul 0.8.2 - this should not affect any users

## v0.18.2 (March 28, 2017)

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Add missing HTTP transport configuration options
  * Add `modulo` function for performing modulo math

BUG FIXES:

  * Default transport max idle connections based on `GOMAXPROCS`
  * Read `VAULT_*` envvars before finalizing [GH-914, GH-916]
  * Register `[]*KeyPair` as a gob [GH-893]

## v0.18.1 (February 7, 2017)

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Add support for tagged addresses and metadata [GH-863]
  * Add `.exe` extension to Windows binaries [GH-875]
  * Add support for customizing the low-level transport details for Consul and
      Vault [GH-880, GH-877]
  * Read token from `~/.vault-token` if it exists [GH-878, GH-884]

BUG FIXES:

  * Resolve an issue with filters on health service dependencies [GH-857]
  * Restore ability to reload configurations from disk [GH-866]
  * Move `env` back to a helper function [GH-882]

    This was causing a lot of issues for users, and it required many folks to
    re-write their templates for the small benefit of people running in
    de-duplicate mode who did not understand the trade-offs. The README is now
    updated with the trade-offs of running in dedup mode and the expected `env`
    behavior has been restored.

  * Do not loop indefinitely if the dedup manager is unable to acquire a lock
      [GH-864]


## v0.18.0 (January 20, 2017)

NEW FEATURES:

  * Add new template function `keyExists` for determining if a key is present.
      See the breaking change notice before for more information about the
      motivation for this change.

  * Add `scratch` for storing information across a template invocation. Scratch
      is especially useful when saving a computed value to use it across a
      template. Scratch values are not shared across multiple templates and are
      not persisted between template invocations

  * Add support for controlling retry behavior for failed communications to
      Consul or Vault. By default, Consul Template will now retry 5 times before
      returning an error. The backoff timing and number of attempts can be tuned
      using the CLI or a configuration file.

  * Add `executeTemplate` function for executing a defined template.

  * Add `base64Decode`, `base64Encode`, `base64URLDecode`, and `base64URLEncode`
      functions for working with base64 encodings.

  * Add `containsAll`, `containsAny`, `containsNone`, and `containsNotAll`
      functions for easy filtering of multiple tag selections.

BREAKING CHANGES:

  * Consul Template now **blocks on `key` queries**. The previous behavior was
      to always pass through, allowing users to use the existence of a key as
      a source of control flow. This caused confusion among many users, so we
      have restored the expected behavior of blocking on a `key` query, but have
      added `keyExists` to check for the existence of a key. Note that the
      `keyOrDefault` function remains unchanged and will not block if the value
      is nil, as expected.

  * The `vault` template function has been removed. This has been deprecated
      with a warning since v0.14.0.

  * A shell is no longer assumed for Template commands. Previous versions of
      Consul Template assumed `/bin/sh` (`cmd` on Windows) as the parent
      process for the template command. Due to user requests and a desire to
      customize the shell, Consul Template no longer wraps the command in a
      shell. For most commands, this change will be transparent. If you were
      utilizing shell-specific functions like `&&`, `||`, or conditionals, you
      will need to wrap you command in a shell, for example:

    ```shell
    -template "in.tpl:out.tpl:/bin/bash -c 'echo a || b'"
    ```

    or

    ```hcl
    template {
      command = "/bin/bash -c 'echo a || b'"
    }
    ```

  * The `env` function is now treated as a dependency instead of a helper. For
      most users, there will be no impact.

  * This release is compiled with Golang v1.8. We do not expect this to cause
      any issues, but it is worth calling out.

DEPRECATIONS:

  * `.Tags.Contains` is deprecated. Templates should make use of the built-in
      `in` and `contains` functions instead. For example:

    ```liquid
    {{ if .Tags.Contains "foo" }}
    ```

    becomes:

    ```liquid
    {{ if .Tags | contains "foo" }}
    ```

    or:

    ```liquid
    {{ if "foo" | in .Tags }}
    ```

  * `key_or_default` has been renamed to `keyOrDefault` to better align with
      Go's naming structure. The old method is aliased and will remain until a
      future release.

  * Consul-specific CLI options are now prefixed with `-consul-`:

    * `-auth` is now `-consul-auth`
    * `-ssl-(.*)` is now `-consul-ssl-$1`
    * `-retry` is now `-consul-retry` and has been broken apart into more
      specific CLI options.

  * Consul-specific configuration options are now nested under a stanza. For
    example:

    ```hcl
    auth {
      username = "foo"
      password = "bar"
    }
    ```

    becomes:

    ```hcl
    consul {
      auth {
        username = "foo"
        password = "bar"
      }
    }
    ```

    This applies to the `auth`, `retry`, `ssl`, and `token` options.

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Add CLI support for all SSL configuration options for both Consul and Vault.
    Vault options are identical to Consul but with `vault-` prefix. Includes
    the addition of `ssl-ca-path` to be consistent with file-based configuration
    options.

    * `ssl` `vault-ssl` (Enable)
    * `ssl-verify` `vault-ssl-verify`
    * `ssl-cert` `vault-ssl-cert`
    * `ssl-key` `vault-ssl-key`
    * `ssl-ca-cert` `vault-ssl-ca-cert`
    * `ssl-ca-path` `vault-ssl-ca-path`
    * `ssl-server-name` `vault-ssl-server-name`

  * Add `-consul-ssl-server-name`
  * Add `-consul-ssl-ca-path`
  * Add `-consul-retry`
  * Add `-consul-retry-attempts`
  * Add `-consul-retry-backoff`
  * Add `-vault-retry`
  * Add `-vault-retry-attempts`
  * Add `-vault-retry-backoff`
  * Add support for `server_name` option for TLS configurations to allow
      specification of the expected certificate common name.
  * Add `-vault-addr` CLI option for specifying the Vault server address
      [GH-740, GH-747]
  * Add tagged addresses to Node structs
  * Add support for multiple `-config` flags [GH-773, GH-751]
  * Add more control over template command execution
  * Add a way to programatically track the dependencies a particular template
      is blocked on [GH-799]

BUG FIXES:

  * Fix `-renew-token` flag not begin honored on the CLI [GH-741, GH-745]
  * Allow `*` in key names [GH-789, GH-755]

## v0.16.0 (September 22, 2016)

NEW FEATURES:

  * **Exec Mode!** Consul Template can now act as a faux-supervisor for
      applications. Please see the [Exec Mode](README.md#exec-mode)
      documentation for more information.
  * **Vault Token Unwrapping!** Consul Template can now unwrap Vault tokens that
      have been wrapped using Vault's cubbyhole response wrapping. Simply add
      the `unwrap_token` option to your Vault configuration stanza or pass in
      the `-vault-unwrap-token` command line flag.

BREAKING CHANGES:

  * Consul Template no longer terminates on SIGTERM or SIGQUIT. Previous
      versions were hard-coded to listen for SIGINT, SIGTERM, and SIGQUIT. This
      value is now configurable, and the default is SIGINT. SIGQUIT will trigger
      a core dump in accordance with similar programs. SIGTERM is no longer
      listened.
  * Consul Template now exits on irrecoverable Vault errors such as failing to
      renew a token or lease.

DEPRECATIONS:

  * The `vault.renew` option has been renamed to `vault.renew_token` for added
      clarity. This is backwards-compatible for this release, but will be
      removed in a future release, so please update your configurations
      accordingly.

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Permit commas in key prefix names [GH-669]
  * Add configurable kill and reload signals [GH-686]
  * Add a command line flag for controlling whether a provided Vault token will
      be renewed [GH-718]

BUG FIXES:

  * Allow variadic template function for `secret` [GH-660, GH-662]
  * Always log in UTC time
  * Log milliseconds [GH-676, GH-674]
  * Maintain template ordering [GH-683]
  * Add `Service` address to catalog node response [GH-687]
  * Do not require trailing slashes [GH-706, GH-713]
  * Wait for all existing dedup acquire attempts to finish [GH-716, GH-677]


## v0.15.0.dev (June 9, 2016)

BREAKING CHANGES:

  * **Removing reaping functionality** [GH-628]

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Allow specifying per-template delimiters [GH-615, GH-389]
  * Allow specifying per-template wait parameters [GH-589, GH-618]
  * Switch to actually vendoring dependencies
  * Add support for writing data [GH-652, GH-492]

BUG FIXES:

  * Close open connections when reloading configuration [GH-591, GH-595]
  * Do not share catalog nodes [GH-611, GH-572, GH-603]
  * Properly handle empty string in ParseUint [GH-610, GH-609]
  * Cache Vault's _original_ lease duration [5b955a8]
  * Use decimal division for calculating Vault lease durations [87d61d9]
  * Load VAULT_TOKEN environment variable [2431448]
  * Properly clean up quiescence timers when using multiple templates [GH-616]
  * Print a nice error if K/V cannot be exploded [GH-617, GH-596]
  * Update documentation about symlinks [GH-579]
  * Properly parse file permissions in mapstructure [GH-626]

## v0.14.0 (March 7, 2016)

DEPRECATIONS:

  * The `vault` template API function has been renamed to `secret` to be in line
    with other tooling. The `vault` API function will continue to work but will
    print a warning to the log file. A future release of Consul Template will
    remove the `vault` API.

NEW FEATURES:

  * Add `secrets` template API for listing secrets in Vault. Please note this
    requires Vault 0.5+ and the secret backend must support listing. Please see
    the Vault documentation for more information [GH-270]

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Allow passing any kind of object to `toJSON` in the template. Previously
    this was restricted to key-value maps, but that restriction is now removed.
    [GH-553]

BUG FIXES:

  * Parse file permissions as a string in JSON [GH-548]
  * Document how to reload config with signals [GH-522]
  * Stop all dependencies when reloading the running/watcher [GH-534, GH-568]

## v0.13.0 (February 18, 2016)

BUG FIXES:

  * Compile with go1.6 to avoid race [GH-442]
  * Switch to using a pooled transport [GH-546]

## v0.12.2 (January 15, 2016)

BUG FIXES:

  * Fixed an issue when running as PID 1 in a Docker container where Consul
    Template could consume CPU and spuriously think its spwaned sub-processes
    had failed [GH-511]

## v0.12.1 (January 7, 2016)

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Add support for math operations on uint types [GH-483, GH-484]
  * Make check information available through health service [GH-490]

BUG FIXES:

  * Store vault data on the dependency and handle an error where a failed
    lease renewal would result in `<no data>` in the rendered template. Please
    note, there is a bug in Vault 0.4 with respect to lease renewals that makes
    it inoperable with Consul Template. Please either use Vault 0.3 or wait
    until Vault 0.5 is released (the bug has already been fixed on master).
    [GH-468, GH-493, GH-504]


## v0.12.0 (December 10, 2015)

BREAKING CHANGES:

  * Add support for checking if a node is in maintenance mode [GH-477, GH-455]

    Previously, Consul Template would report nodes in maintenance mode as
    "critical". They will now report as "maintenance" so users can perform more
    detailed filtering. It is unlikely, but if you were filtering critical
    services, nodes/services in maintenance mode will no longer be included.


FEATURES:

  * Add support for de-duplication mode. In de-duplication mode, Consul Template
    uses leader election to elect one Consul Template process to render a
    template. The results of this template are rendered into Consul's key-value
    store, and other templates pull from the pre-rendered template. This option
    is off by default, but it is highly recommended that the option is enabled
    for clusters with a high load factor (number of templates x number of
    dependencies per template). [GH-465]
  * Add support for automatically reaping child processes. This is very useful
    when running Consul Template as PID 1 (like in a Docker container) when no
    init system is present. The option is configurable, but it defaults to "on"
    when the Consul Template process is PID 1. [GH-428, GH-479]


IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Use the `renew-self` endpoint instead of `renew` for renewing the token
    [GH-450]
  * Allow existing templates to be backed up before writing the new one [GH-464]
  * Add support for TLS/SSL mutual authentication [GH-448]
  * Add support for checking if a node is in maintenance mode [GH-477, GH-455]


## v0.11.1 (October 26, 2015)

FEATURES:

  * Accept "unix" as an argument to `timestamp` to generate a unix
    timestamp [GH-422]

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Make `Path` a public field on the vault secret dependency so other libraries
    can access it

BUG FIXES:

  * Ensure there is a newline at the end of the version output
  * Update README development instructions [GH-423]
  * Adjust error messages so that data does not always "come from Consul"
  * Fix race conditions in tests
  * Update the `LastContact` value for non-Consul dependencies to always
    return 0 [GH-432, GH-433]
  * Always use `DefaultConfig()` in tests to find issues
  * Fix broken math functions - previously add, subtract, multiply, and divide
    for integers would perform the operation on only the first operand
    [GH-430, GH-435]
  * Renew the vault token based off of the auth, not the secret [GH-443]
  * Remove noisy log message [GH-445]


## v0.11.0 (October 9, 2015)

BREAKING CHANGES:

  * Allow configuration of destination file permissions [GH-415, GH-358]

    Previously, Consul Template would inspect the file at the destination path
    and mirror those file permissions, if a file existed. If a file did not
    exist, Consul Template would render the file with 0644 permissions. This was
    acceptable behavior in a pre-Vault world, but now that Consul Template is
    capable of rendering secrets, there is a desire for increased security. As
    such, Consul Template **no longer mirrors existing destination file
    permissions**. Instead, users can specify the file permissions in the
    configuration file. Please see the README for examples. If you were
    previously relying on an existing file's file permissions to enfore the
    destination file permissions, you must switch to specifying the file
    permissions in the configuration file. If you were not dependent on this
    behavior, nothing has changed; the default value is still 0644.

FEATURES:

  * Add `in` and `contains` functions for checking if a slice or array contains
    a given value [GH-366]
  * Add `add` function for calculating the sum of integers/floats
  * Add `subtract` function for calculating the difference of integers/floats
  * Add `multiply` function for calculating the product of integers/floats
  * Add `divide` function for calculating the division of integers/floats

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Sort serivces by ID as well
  * Add a mechanism for renewing the given Vault token [GH-359, GH-367]
  * Default max-stale to 1s - this severely reduces the load on the Consul
    leader by allowing followers to respond to API requests [GH-386, GH-397]
  * Add GPG signing for SHASUMS on new releases
  * Push watcher errors down to the client in `once` mode [GH-361, GH-418]

BUG FIXES:

  * Set ssl in the CLI [GH-321]
  * **Regression** - Reload configuration on SIGHUP [GH-332]
  * Remove port option from `service` query and documentation - it was unused
    and legacy, but was causing issues and confusion [GH-333]
  * Return the empty value when no parsable value is given [GH-353]
  * Start with a blank configuration when reloading via SIGHUP [GH-393, GH-394]
