# Windows IIS Driver

Name: `nomad_iis`

This plugin is a task driver to run IIS Web Applications on Windows Servers. Each allocation will create an AppPool and a Website.  
For a full documentation please refer to the project's [Readme](https://github.com/sevensolutions/nomad-iis/blob/main/README.md).

Unlike most other Nomad task drivers, this one is written in the C# language using ASP.NET. It uses the Microsoft.Web.Administration-API to communicate with IIS.

<Note>
At the moment I'm developing this plugin as a hobby project. Version 1 has not yet been reached and breaking changes may still occur.

## Sample Job

```hcl
job "iis-test" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
  type = "service"

  group "iis-test" {
    count = 1
    
    network {
      port "httplabel" {}
    }

    task "iis-test" {
      driver = "iis"

      config {
        application {
          path = "C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot"
        }
        application {
          alias = "subapp"
          path = "C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot"
        }
        
        binding {
          type = "http"
          port = "httplabel"
        }
      }
      
      env {
        my_key = "my-value"
      }

      resources {
        cpu    = 100
        memory = 20
      }
    }
  }
}
```
