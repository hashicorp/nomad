# Command: stop

The `stop` command is used to stop a running job and signals the scheduler
to cancel all of the running allocations.

## Usage

```
nomad stop [options] <job>
```

The stop command requires a single argument, specifying the job ID to
cancel.

Upon successful deregistraion, an interactive monitor session will start to
display log lines as the job unwinds its allocations and completes shutting
down. The monitor will exit once all allocations are stopped and the job has
reached a terminal state. It is safe to exit the monitor early using ctrl+c.

## General Options

<%= general_options_usage %>

## Stop Options

* `-detach`: Return immediately instead of monitoring. A new evaluation ID
  will be output, which can be used to call the monitor later using the
  [eval-monitor](/docs/commands/eval-monitor.html) command.

## Examples

Stop the job with ID "job1":

```
$ nomad stop job1
==> Monitoring evaluation "43bfe672-e9a2-1cb8-457a-4c2dca5ce1c7"
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "43bfe672-e9a2-1cb8-457a-4c2dca5ce1c7" finished with status "complete"
```

Stop the job with ID "job1" and return immediately:

```
$ nomad stop -detach job1

```
