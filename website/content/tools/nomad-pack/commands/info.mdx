#### Operation Options

- `-var-file=<string>` - Specifies the path to a variable override file. This can
						be provided multiple times on a single command to result
						in a list of files.
- `-allow-unset-vars` - Suppress errors from unset variables without default values.
					Equivalent of setting the NOMAD_PACK_ALLOW_UNSET_VARS environment variable to "1" or "true".
- `-ignore-missing-vars` - Determines whether override variables not present in the
					pack should be ignored or produce an error.
- `-var=<key=value>` - Specifies single override variables in the form of HCL
					syntax and can be specified multiple times per command.
- `-name=<string>` - If set, this will be the unique identifier of this deployed
					instance of the specified pack. If not set, the pack name
					will be used. This is useful for running more than one
					instance of a pack within the same cluster. Note that this
					name must be globally unique within a cluster. Running the
					run command multiple times with the same name, will just
					re-submit the same pack, and apply changes if you have made
					any to the underlying pack. Be mindful that, whether you
					have made changes or not, the underlying Allocations will be
					replaced. When managing packs, the name specified here is
					the name that should be passed to nomad-pack's plan and
					destroy commands.
- `-parser-v1` - Use the legacy syntax parser to parse your job. This
			enables pack to run packs for earlier versions while you are
			migrating them to the new syntax

#### Render Options

- `-registry=<string>` - Specific registry name containing the pack to retrieve info
					about. If not specified, the default registry will be used.
- `-ref=<string>` - Specific git ref of the pack to retrieve info about.
					Supports tags, SHA, and latest. If no ref is specified,
					defaults to latest.

					Using ref with a file path is not supported.
