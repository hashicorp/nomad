# `nomad recommendation dismiss` command reference

The `recommendation dismiss` command is used to dismiss recommendations.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad recommendation dismiss [options] <recommendation_ids>

The `recommendation dismiss` command requires at least one recommendation ID
to be passed to it. Multiple IDs can be passed, with each recommendation ID
separated from the next by a space.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the `submit-job`,
`read-job`, and `submit-recommendation` capabilities for the recommendation's
namespace.
