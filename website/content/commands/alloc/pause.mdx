# Command: alloc pause

<EnterpriseAlert />

~> **Note:** Time based task execution is an experimental feature and subject
to change. This feature is supported for select customers. Please refer to the
[Upgrade Guide][upgrade] to find breaking changes. 

Override the schedule for tasks using time based execution.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad alloc pause [options] <allocation> <command>
```

The `alloc pause` command allows a user to override the schedule for tasks
that use time based execution. A user may override a task's
[`schedule`][schedule] and force it to run or stop. The `schedule` will be
ignored until a user resets the override.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires the `job-submit` capability for
the allocation's namespace.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Pause Options

- `-state`: Override the current scheduled task state to be the specified state
  or reset to the scheduled state. Must be one of `pause`, `run`, or
  `scheduled`. When set to `pause` the task is halted. When set to `run` the
  task is started. When set to `scheduled` the task respects its
  [`schedule`][schedule].

- `-status`: Get the current time based task execution state.

- `-task`: Override the schedule of the specified task. May also be specified
  as a positional argument.

- `-verbose`: Show full information.

## Examples

The following command stops the `schedtask` task of the allocation `4d37a9d1`
overriding the task's [`schedule`][schedule] block:

```shell-session
$ nomad alloc pause -state=pause 4d37a9d1 schedtask
```

The following command runs the task overriding the tasks current state or
schedule:

```shell-session
$ nomad alloc pause -state=pause 4d37a9d1 schedtask
```

The following command returns the task to its [`schedule`][schedule]:

```shell-session
$ nomad alloc pause -state=scheduled 4d37a9d1 schedtask
```
