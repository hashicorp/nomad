# `secret` block in the job specification

<Placement
  groups={[
    ['job', 'secret'],
    ['job', 'group', 'secret'],
    ['job', 'group', 'task', 'secret'],
  ]}
/>

The `secret` block allows a task to specify that it requires a secret from
a specified location. Nomad automatically retrieves the contents of the
secret, which you may reference as a variable within the task specification.
If specified at the `group` level, the secret is available to every task
within the group. If specified at the `job` level, every task in the job
fetches the secret and is able to interpret it within the task specification.

```hcl
job "docs" {
  group "example" {
    task "server" {
      secret "my_secret" {
        provider = "vault"
        path     = "path/to/secret"
        config   = {
          engine = "kv_v2"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Nomad parses the key value pairs in a secret and makes them available for
variable interpolation in the following format:
`secret.<secret_name>.<secret_key>`. To use the preceding task specification
as an example, you would reference the value in the secret key "foo"  as
`${secret.my_secret.foo}`.

## Parameters

- `provider` `(string: "")` - Specifies the underlying implementation to use in
  order for Nomad to interact with a specific secret store.

- `path` `(string: "")` - Specifies the location of the secret within the given
  secret store.

- `config` `(block: {})` - Specifies any custom attributes used by built-in
  providers order to fetch the secret. Only available for built-in `vault` and
  `nomad` providers.

- `env` `(map[string]string)` - Specifies any environment variables to pass to a
  custom plugin provider. Only available for custom providers.

## Built-in providers

- `nomad` - Query variables from Nomad. Nomad uses the task's [Workload
  Identity] [Workload Identity] token in order to fetch the variable, so the
  task must have the necessary access via ACLs to read the variable.

  Config parameters:

   - `namespace` `(string: "default")` - Specifies the namespace where the
  variable is located.


- `vault` - Query secrets from Vault. Similar to the template block, making
  requests to Vault requires a vault token, which is generated via the
  [vault][vault] block.

  Config parameters:

    - `engine` `(string: "kv_v2")` - Specifies what Vault storage engine to
  query. Options are `kv_v1` and `kv_v2`.


## Custom providers

Nomad extends the provider list via the use of custom providers plugins. Custom
providers must implement both the `fingerprint` and `fetch` functionality. You
must place custom providers in the `common_plugin_dir/secrets/` subdirectory. On
startup, the Nomad client fingerprints executables in the secrets directory by
executing it with the first argument of `fingerblock`. When using a custom
plugin "foo", Nomad looks for an executable "foo" and runs it with the first
argument being "fetch", and the second argument being the secret's path
parameter. Refer to the [plugin authoring][secret-provider] guide on secret providers
for an example custom provider.

A custom provider should print to stdout a fingerprint response:

```json
{
  "type": "secrets",
  "version": "0.0.1" (use appropriate version)
}
```

And a valid "fetch" response should have the form:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2"
  },
  "error": ""
}
```
