  Create and deploy Nomad ACL policies for application developers and production operators to implement the principle of least privilege.
---

# Create ACL policies

In this guide, you will create Nomad ACL policies to provide controlled
access for two different personas to your Nomad Cluster. You will use the sample
job created with the `nomad init -short` command as a sample job.

To complete this guide, you will need the following:

- A Nomad cluster with the ACL system bootstrapped.

- A management token. You can use the bootstrap token, however, for production
  systems you should use an user-specific token.

## Meet the personas

In this guide, you will create policies to manage cluster access for two
different user personas. These are contrived to suit the scenario, and
you should design your ACL policies around your organization's specific needs.

As a best practice, access should be limited as much as possible given the needs
of the user's roles.

<Tip title="Challenge">

 Consider extending this scenario to include namespaces.

</Tip>

### Application Developer

The application developer needs to be able to deploy an application into the
Nomad cluster and control its lifecycle. They should not be able to perform any
other node operations.

Application developers are allowed to fetch logs from their running containers,
but should not be allowed to run commands inside of them or access the filesystem for running workloads.

### Production Operations

The production operations team needs to be able to perform cluster
maintenance and view the workload, including attached resources like
volumes, in the running cluster. However, because the application
developers are the owners of the running workload, the production
operators should not be allowed to run or stop jobs in the cluster.

## Write the policy rules

### Application Developer policy

Considering the requirements listed above, what rules should you add to your
policy? Nomad will deny all requests that are not explicitly permitted, so focus
on the policies and capabilities you would like to permit. However, be mindful
of the coarse-grained permissions in `namespace` rules--they might grant more
permissions than you need for your use case.

> The application developer needs to be able to deploy an application into the Nomad cluster and control its lifecycle. They should not be able to perform any other node operations.

> Application developers are allowed to fetch logs from their running containers, but should not be allowed to run commands inside of them or access the filesystem for running workloads.

Recall that [`namespace` rules] govern the job application deployment behaviors
and introspection capabilities for a Nomad cluster.

First define the policy in terms of required capabilities. What capabilities
from the available options will this policy need to provide to Application
Developers?

Remember that the coarse-grained `policy` value of a namespace rule is a list of
capabilities.

Express this in policy form. Create an file named `app-dev.policy.hcl` to write
your policy.

```hcl
namespace "default" {
  policy       = "read"
  capabilities = ["submit-job","dispatch-job","read-logs"]
}
```

Note that the namespace rule has `policy = "read"`. The **write** policy is not
suitable because it is overly permissive, granting "read-fs", "alloc-exec", and
"alloc-lifecycle".

### Production Operations policy

Consider the requirements listed above, what rules should you add to your
policy? Nomad will deny all requests that are not explicitly supplied, so focus
on the policies you would like to permit.

> The production operations team needs to be able to perform cluster maintenance and view the workload, including attached resources like volumes, in the running cluster. However, because the application developers are the owners of the running workload, the production operators should not be allowed to run or stop jobs in the cluster.

Express this in policy form. Create an file named `prod-ops.policy.hcl` to write
your policy. The capabilities required over the Namespace API is captured with
the `read` policy value.

```hcl
namespace "default" {
  policy = "read"
}
```

Operators will also need to have access to several other API endpoints: node,
agent, operator. Consult the individual API documentation for more details on
the endpoints.

```hcl
node {
  policy = "write"
}

agent {
  policy = "write"
}

operator {
  policy = "write"
}

plugin {
  policy = "list"
}
```

Add all of these policy elements to your `prod-ops.policy.hcl` file and save it.

Use the `nomad acl policy apply` command to upload your policy specifications.
Don't forget to provide a management token via the NOMAD_TOKEN environment
variable or the `-token` flag. As practice, this time use the `-token` flag.

Upload the "Application Developer policy."

```shell-session
$ nomad acl policy apply -description "Application Developer policy" app-dev app-dev.policy.hcl
Successfully wrote "app-dev" ACL policy!
```

Upload the "Production Operations policy."

```shell-session
$ nomad acl policy apply -description "Production Operations policy" prod-ops prod-ops.policy.hcl
Successfully wrote "prod-ops" ACL policy!
```

## Verify the policy

In order to verify the policy works properly, you will need to create tokens and
check the success case and the failure cases.

Create an app-dev token. For this guide, pipe your output into the tee command
to save it as `app-dev.token`.

```shell-session
$ nomad acl token create -name="Test app-dev token" -policy=app-dev -type=client | tee app-dev.token
Accessor ID  = b8c67cb8-cc3b-2a7c-182a-0bc5dfc3a6ff
Secret ID    = 17cadb8b-e8a8-2f47-db62-fea0c6a19602
Name         = Test app-dev token
Type         = client
Global       = false
Policies     = [app-dev]
Create Time  = 2020-02-10 18:41:43.049735 +0000 UTC
Create Index = 14
Modify Index = 14
```

Next, create a prod-ops token, piping your output into the tee command to save
it as `prod-ops.token`.

```shell-session
$ nomad acl token create -name="Test prod-ops token" -policy=prod-ops -type=client | tee prod-ops.token
Accessor ID  = 4e3c1ac7-52d0-6c68-94a2-5e75f17e657e
Secret ID    = 0be3c623-cc90-3645-c29d-5f0629084f68
Name         = Test prod-ops token
Type         = client
Global       = false
Policies     = [prod-ops]
Create Time  = 2020-02-10 18:41:53.851133 +0000 UTC
Create Index = 15
Modify Index = 15
```

### Submit a job using each token

First, set the active token to your test app-dev token. You can extract it from
the files that you created above.

```shell-session
$ export NOMAD_TOKEN=$(awk '/Secret/ {print $4}' app-dev.token)
```

Create the sample job with `nomad init`.

```shell-session
$ nomad init
```

Submit the sample job to your Nomad cluster.

```shell-session
$ nomad job run example.nomad.hcl
==> Monitoring evaluation "0acad62d"
    Evaluation triggered by job "example"
    Allocation "8b54bf75" created: node "afcb4e20", group "cache"
    Evaluation within deployment: "63bbb604"
    Allocation "8b54bf75" status changed: "pending" -> "running" (Tasks are running)
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "0acad62d" finished with status "complete"
```

Verify that the job starts completely using the `nomad job status` command.

```shell-session
$ nomad job status example
ID            = example
Name          = example
Submit Date   = 2020-02-10T13:42:17-05:00
Type          = service
Priority      = 50
Datacenters   = dc1
Status        = running
Periodic      = false
Parameterized = false

Summary
Task Group  Queued  Starting  Running  Failed  Complete  Lost
cache       0       0         1        0       0         0

Latest Deployment
ID          = 63bbb604
Status      = running
Description = Deployment is running

Deployed
Task Group  Desired  Placed  Healthy  Unhealthy  Progress Deadline
cache       1        1       0        0          2020-02-10T13:52:17-05:00

Allocations
ID        Node ID   Task Group  Version  Desired  Status   Created  Modified
8b54bf75  afcb4e20  cache       0        run      running  26s ago  25s ago
```

Switch to the prod-ops token.

```shell-session
$ export NOMAD_TOKEN=$(awk '/Secret/ {print $4}' prod-ops.token)
```

Try to stop the job; note that you are unable to do so.

```shell-session
$ nomad stop example
Error deregistering job: Unexpected response code: 403 (Permission denied)
```

Switch back to the app-dev token.

```shell-session
$ export NOMAD_TOKEN=$(awk '/Secret/ {print $4}' app-dev.token)

$ nomad stop example
==> Monitoring evaluation "2571f9f9"
    Evaluation triggered by job "example"
    Evaluation within deployment: "63bbb604"
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "2571f9f9" finished with status "complete"
```

Try again to stop the job; note that this time you are successful.

```shell-session
$ nomad stop example
==> Monitoring evaluation "2571f9f9"
    Evaluation triggered by job "example"
    Evaluation within deployment: "63bbb604"
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "2571f9f9" finished with status "complete"
```

### Stimulate GC on your cluster

With the app-dev token still active, export your cluster address into a variable for convenience.

```shell-session
$ export NOMAD_ADDR=http://localhost:4646
```

Try to use the Nodes API to list out the Nomad clients in the cluster.

```shell-session
$ curl --header "X-Nomad-Token: ${NOMAD_TOKEN}" ${NOMAD_ADDR}/v1/nodes
Permission denied
```

Set the active token to your test prod-ops token.

```shell-session
$ export NOMAD_TOKEN=$(awk '/Secret/ {print $4}' prod-ops.token)
```

Resubmit your Nodes API query. Expect to have a significant amount of JSON
returned to your screen which indicates successful API call.

```shell-session
$ curl --header "X-Nomad-Token: ${NOMAD_TOKEN}" ${NOMAD_ADDR}/v1/nodes
```

## Challenge: Restrict anonymous users

The bootstrapping guide provides a very permissive anonymous user policy to
minimize user and workload impacts from Nomad's default deny-all policy. This
allows cluster users and other submitting agents to continue to work while
tokens are being created and deployed.

As a challenge to yourself, consider the minimum viable set of permissions for
anonymous users in your organization. Craft a policy that prevents user access
to capabilities that are not in your user's critical path.

## Clean up

If you would like to remove the objects that you created in this guide, switch
back to your management token and revoke the tokens that you created above using
the accessors in the files.

~> If you receive a "Permission denied" error when you are running the delete
commands, ensure that you have loaded your management token back into the
NOMAD_TOKEN environment variable.

```shell-session
$ nomad acl token delete $(awk '/Accessor/ {print $4}' prod-ops.token)
Token 4e3c1ac7-52d0-6c68-94a2-5e75f17e657e successfully deleted
```

```shell-session
$ nomad acl token delete $(awk '/Accessor/ {print $4}' app-dev.token)
Token b8c67cb8-cc3b-2a7c-182a-0bc5dfc3a6ff successfully deleted
```

Next, remove the prod-ops and app-dev policies that you created.

```shell-session
$ nomad acl policy delete prod-ops
Successfully deleted prod-ops policy!
```

```shell-session
$ nomad acl policy delete app-dev
Successfully deleted app-dev policy!
```

## Next steps

Now that you have deployed your own policy into the cluster, you will learn
about Nomad access tokens. Nomad users will need to provide tokens for
non-anonymous requests. These tokens map to one or more ACL policies which
define the accessible Nomad objects for that request.
