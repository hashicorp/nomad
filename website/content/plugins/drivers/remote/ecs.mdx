# ECS Task Driver

Name: `nomad-driver-ecs`

Homepage: https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad-driver-ecs

~> **Note:** The ECS Task Driver is an example Remote Task Driver and **not
intended for production use.**

The ECS task driver plugin for Nomad allows running [AWS ECS][ecs] tasks via
Nomad. Allocations for these jobs are scheduled onto Nomad clients like
traditional task drivers, however the actual task is executed remotely in
AWS ECS. The Nomad client agent manages the remote ECS task like any other
local Nomad task: restarting it if it fails, stopping it when requested, etc.

When a Nomad node assigned allocations with ECS tasks is drained, the ECS tasks
are *not stopped.* Instead the replacement allocations reconnect to the
original ECS tasks to avoid unnecessary downtime.

If a Nomad node assigned allocations with ECS tasks crashes and is considered
`down`, the replacement allocations for the `lost` allocations reconnect to the
original ECS tasks to avoid unnecessary downtime. If the original crashed Nomad
node restarts, it will detect `lost` allocations and stop monitoring them since
a new node has taken over.

## Client Requirements

The AWS ECS Task Driver is not currently built into Nomad and must be
[downloaded][download] onto the client host in the configured [plugin
directory][plugin_dir].

### Plugin Options

Once the plugin binary is installed, the plugin must be configured in your
Nomad client agent's HCL:

```hcl
plugin "nomad-driver-ecs" {
  config {
    enabled = true

    #  AWS ECS Cluster to run tasks in
    cluster = "nomad-remote-driver-cluster"

    # AWS ECS Region to run tasks in
    region  = "us-east-1"
  }
}
```

- `cluster` - The [AWS ECS cluster][cluster] to run tasks in.
- `region` - The [AWS region][region] to run tasks in.

## Task Configuration

Nomad ECS tasks must first be defined for the ECS cluster. See the [Nomad ECS
driver demo][demo] task for an example ECS task provisioned by Terraform.

Once the ECS task is provisioned, Nomad may run it via a job:

```hcl
job "nomad-ecs-demo" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]

  group "ecs-remote-task-demo" {
    restart {
      attempts = 0
      mode     = "fail"
    }

    reschedule {
      delay = "5s"
    }

    task "http-server" {
      driver       = "ecs"
      kill_timeout = "1m" // increased from default to accomodate ECS.

      config {
        task {
          launch_type     = "FARGATE"
          task_definition = "nomad-remote-driver-demo:1"
          network_configuration {
            aws_vpc_configuration {
              assign_public_ip = "ENABLED"
              security_groups  = ["sg-0d647d4c7ce15034f"]
              subnets          = ["subnet-010b03f1a021887ff"]
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- `config.task` stanza defines the configuration of the ECS task:

  - `launch_type` - The launch type on which to run your task.
  - `task_definition` - The family and revision (`family:revision`) or full ARN
    of the task definition to run.
  - `network_configuration` - The network configuration for the task (eg
    `awsvpc` for `FARGATE` tasks).

    - `aws_vpc_configuration` - The VPC subnets and security groups associated with a task.

      - `assign_public_ip` - Whether the task's elastic network interface receives a public IP address.
      - `security_groups` - The security groups associated with the task or service.
      - `subnets` - The subnets associated with the task or service.
