# Nomad-Pack Stop

Command: `nomad-pack stop`

Stop a running pack

@include "tools/nomad-pack/commands/stop_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `nomad-pack stop <pack name> [options]`


	Stop the specified Nomad Pack in the configured Nomad cluster. To delete the
	pack from the cluster, specify "--purge", or use the "nomad-pack destroy"
	command.

	By default, the stop command will stop ALL jobs in the pack deployment. If a
	pack was run using variable overrides to specify the job name(s), the same
	variable overrides MUST be provided when stopping the pack to guarantee that
	nomad-pack targets the correct job(s) in the pack deployment.

Examples:
	# Stop an example pack in deployment "dev"
	nomad-pack stop example --name=dev

	# Stop an example pack in deployment "dev" and purge it from the system
	nomad-pack stop example --name=dev --purge

	# Stop an example pack in deployment "dev" that has a job named "test"
	# If the same pack has been installed in deployment "dev" but overriding the
	# job name to "hello", only "test" will be stopped
	nomad-pack stop example --name=dev --var=job_name=test

#### Operation Options

- `-var-file=<string>` - Specifies the path to a variable override file. This can
						be provided multiple times on a single command to result
						in a list of files.
- `-allow-unset-vars` - Suppress errors from unset variables without default values.
					Equivalent of setting the NOMAD_PACK_ALLOW_UNSET_VARS environment variable to "1" or "true".
- `-ignore-missing-vars` - Determines whether override variables not present in the
					pack should be ignored or produce an error.
- `-var=<key=value>` - Specifies single override variables in the form of HCL
					syntax and can be specified multiple times per command.
- `-name=<string>` - If set, this will be the unique identifier of this deployed
					instance of the specified pack. If not set, the pack name
					will be used. This is useful for running more than one
					instance of a pack within the same cluster. Note that this
					name must be globally unique within a cluster. Running the
					run command multiple times with the same name, will just
					re-submit the same pack, and apply changes if you have made
					any to the underlying pack. Be mindful that, whether you
					have made changes or not, the underlying Allocations will be
					replaced. When managing packs, the name specified here is
					the name that should be passed to nomad-pack's plan and
					destroy commands.
- `-parser-v1` - Use the legacy syntax parser to parse your job. This
			enables pack to run packs for earlier versions while you are
			migrating them to the new syntax

#### Nomad Cluster Options

- `-address=<string>` - The address of the Nomad server.
					Overrides the NOMAD_ADDR environment variable if set.
- `-namespace=<string>` - The target namespace for queries and actions bound to a namespace.
					Overrides the NOMAD_NAMESPACE environment variable if set.
- `-region=<string>` - The region of the Nomad servers to forward commands to.
					Overrides the NOMAD_REGION environment variable if set.
- `-ca-cert=<string>` - Path to a PEM encoded CA cert file to use to verify the
					Nomad server SSL certificate. Overrides the NOMAD_CACERT
					environment variable if set.
- `-client-cert=<string>` - Path to a PEM encoded client certificate for TLS authentication
					to the Nomad server. Must also specify --client-key. Overrides
					the NOMAD_CLIENT_CERT environment variable if set.
- `-client-key=<string>` - Path to an unencrypted PEM encoded private key matching the
					client certificate from --client-cert. Overrides the
					NOMAD_CLIENT_KEY environment variable if set.
- `-tls-server-name=<string>` - The server name to use as the SNI host when connecting via
					TLS. Overrides the NOMAD_TLS_SERVER_NAME environment variable
					if set.
- `-token=<string>` - The SecretID of an ACL token to use to authenticate API requests with.
					Overrides the NOMAD_TOKEN environment variable if set.
- `-tls-skip-verify` - Do not verify TLS certificate. This is highly not recommended.
						Verification will also be skipped if NOMAD_SKIP_VERIFY is set.

#### Stop Options

- `-registry=<string>` - Specific registry name containing the pack to be stopped.
- `-ref=<string>` - Specific git ref of the pack to be stopped.
					Supports tags, SHA, and latest. If no ref is specified,
					defaults to latest.

					Using ref with a file path is not supported.
- `-purge` - Purge is used to stop packs and purge them from the system.
					If not set, packs will still be queryable and will be purged
					by the garbage collector.
- `-global` - Stop multi-region pack in all its regions. By default, pack
					stop will stop only a single region at a time. Ignored for
					single-region jobs.
