# `template` Block

<Placement groups={['job', 'group', 'task', 'template']} />

The `template` block instantiates an instance of a template renderer. This
creates a convenient way to ship configuration files that are populated from
environment variables, Consul data, Vault secrets, or just general
configurations within a Nomad task.

```hcl
job "docs" {
  group "example" {
    task "server" {
      template {
        source        = "local/redis.conf.tpl"
        destination   = "local/redis.conf"
        change_mode   = "signal"
        change_signal = "SIGINT"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Nomad utilizes [Go template][gt] and a tool called [Consul Template][ct], which
adds a set of new functions that can be used to retrieve data from Consul and
Vault. Nomad templates can reference [Nomad's runtime
environment variables][env], [node attributes and metadata][nodevars],
[Nomad service registrations][ct_api_nsvc], and [Nomad variables][nvars].
Templates can also be used to provide environment variables to your workload.

For a full list of the API template functions, please refer to the [Consul
Template documentation][ct_api]. For a an introduction to Go templates, please
refer to the [Learn Go Template Syntax][gt_learn] guide.

## `template` Parameters

- `change_mode` `(string: "restart")` - Specifies the behavior Nomad should take
  if the rendered template changes. Nomad will always write the new contents of
  the template to the specified destination. The following possible values describe
  Nomad's action after writing the template to disk.

  - `"noop"` - take no action (continue running the task)
  - `"restart"` - restart the task
  - `"signal"` - send a configurable signal to the task
  - `"script"` - run a script

- `change_signal` `(string: "")` - Specifies the signal to send to the task as a
  string like `"SIGUSR1"` or `"SIGINT"`. This option is required if the
  `change_mode` is `signal`.

- `change_script` <code>([`ChangeScript`][]: nil)</code> - Configures the script
  triggered on template change. This option is required if the `change_mode` is
  `script`.

- `data` `(string: "")` - Specifies the raw template to execute. One of `source`
  or `data` must be specified, but not both. This is useful for smaller
  templates, but we recommend using `source` for larger templates.

- `destination` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the location where the
  resulting template should be rendered, relative to the [task working
  directory]. Only drivers without filesystem isolation (ex. `raw_exec`) or
  that build a chroot in the task working directory (ex. `exec`) can render
  templates outside of the `NOMAD_ALLOC_DIR`, `NOMAD_TASK_DIR`, or
  `NOMAD_SECRETS_DIR`. For more details on how `destination` interacts with
  task drivers, see the [Filesystem internals][] documentation. Note that where
  possible, the `NOMAD_SECRETS_DIR` is mounted `noexec`, so rendered templates
  can't be used as self-executing scripts.

- `env` `(bool: false)` - Specifies the template should be read back in as
  environment variables for the task ([example](#environment-variables)). To
  update the environment on changes, you must set `change_mode` to
  `restart`. Setting `env` when the `change_mode` is `signal` will return a
  validation error. Setting `env` when the `change_mode` is `noop` is
  permitted but will not update the environment variables in the task.

- `error_on_missing_key` `(bool: false)` - Specifies how the template behaves
  when attempting to index a map key that does not exist in the map.

  - When `true`, the template engine will return an error, which will cause the
    task to fail.

  - When `false`, the template engine will do nothing and continue executing the
    template.	If printed, the result of the index operation is the string
	  "<no value\>".

- `left_delimiter` `(string: "{{")` - Specifies the left delimiter to use in the
  template. The default is "{{" for some templates, it may be easier to use a
  different delimiter that does not conflict with the output file itself.

- `perms` `(string: "644")` - Specifies the rendered template's permissions.
  File permissions are given as octal of the Unix file permissions `rwxrwxrwx`.

- `uid` `(int: nil)` - Specifies the rendered template owner's user ID. If
  negative or not specified (`nil`) the ID of the Nomad agent user will be used.

  ~> **Caveat:** Works only on Unix-based systems. Be careful when using
  containerized drivers, such as `docker` or `podman`, as groups and users
  inside the container may have different IDs than on the host system. This
  feature will also **not** work with Docker Desktop.

- `gid` `(int: nil)` - Specifies the rendered template owner's group ID. If
  negative or not specified (`nil`) the ID of the Nomad agent group will be
  used.

  ~> **Caveat:** Works only on Unix-based systems. Be careful when using
  containerized drivers, such as `docker` or `podman`, as groups and users
  inside the container may have different IDs than on the host system. This
  feature will also **not** work with Docker Desktop.

- `right_delimiter` `(string: "}}")` - Specifies the right delimiter to use in the
  template. The default is "}}" for some templates, it may be easier to use a
  different delimiter that does not conflict with the output file itself.

- `source` `(string: "")` - Specifies the path to the template to be rendered.
  One of `source` or `data` must be specified, but not both. This source can
  optionally be fetched using an [`artifact`][artifact] resource. This template
  must exist on the machine prior to starting the task; it is not possible to
  reference a template that's source is inside a Docker container, for example.

- `splay` `(string: "5s")` - Specifies a random amount of time to wait between
  0 ms and the given splay value before invoking the change mode. This is
  specified using a label suffix like "30s" or "1h", and is often used to
  prevent a thundering herd problem where all task instances restart at the same
  time.

- `wait` `(Code: nil)` - Defines the minimum and maximum amount of time to wait
  for the Consul cluster to reach a consistent state before rendering a template.
  This is useful to enable in systems where network connectivity to Consul is degraded,
  because it will reduce the number of times a template is rendered. This setting
  can be overridden by the [`client.template.wait_bounds`]. If the template
  configuration has a `min` lower than `client.template.wait_bounds.min` or a `max`
  greater than `client.template.wait_bounds.max`, the client's bounds will be enforced,
  and the template `wait` will be adjusted before being sent to the template
  engine.

  ```hcl
  wait {
    min     = "5s"
    max     = "10s"
  }
  ```

- `vault_grace` `(string: "15s")` - [Deprecated](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template/issues/1268)

## `template` Examples

The following examples only show the `template` blocks. Remember that the
`template` block is only valid in the placements listed above.

### Inline Template

This example uses an inline template to render a file to disk. This file watches
various keys in Consul for changes:

```hcl
template {
  data        = "---\nkey: {{ key \"service/my-key\" }}"
  destination = "local/file.yml"
}
```

It is also possible to use heredocs for multi-line templates, like:

```hcl
template {
  data = <<EOH
  ---
    bind_port:   {{ env "NOMAD_PORT_db" }}
    scratch_dir: {{ env "NOMAD_TASK_DIR" }}
    node_id:     {{ env "node.unique.id" }}
    service_key: {{ key "service/my-key" }}
  EOH

  destination = "local/file.yml"
}
```

### Remote Template

This example uses an [`artifact`][artifact] block to download an input template
before passing it to the template engine:

```hcl
artifact {
  source      = "https://example.com/file.yml.tpl"
  destination = "local/file.yml.tpl"
}

template {
  source      = "local/file.yml.tpl"
  destination = "local/file.yml"
}
```

### Task `meta` values

To render values from a task's `meta` config, use the environment variable form
of the meta variable name.

```hcl
meta {
  mykey = "some_value"
}

template {
  data = <<EOH
  {{ env "NOMAD_META_mykey" }}
EOH
}
```

### Node Variables

Use the `env` function to access the Node's attributes and metadata inside a
template. Note the `meta.` syntax here applies only to node meta fields.

```hcl
template {
  data = <<EOH
  ---
    node_dc:    {{ env "node.datacenter" }}
    node_cores: {{ env "attr.cpu.numcores" }}
    meta_key:   {{ env "meta.node_meta_key" }}
  EOH

  destination = "local/file.yml"
}
```

### Environment Variables

Templates may be used to create environment variables for tasks. These templates
work exactly like other templates except once the templates are written, they
are parsed as `KEY=value` pairs. Those key value pairs are included in the
task's environment.

For example the following template block:

```hcl
template {
  data = <<EOH
# Lines starting with a # are ignored

# Empty lines are also ignored
LOG_LEVEL="{{key "service/geo-api/log-verbosity"}}"
API_KEY="{{with secret "secret/geo-api-key"}}{{.Data.value}}{{end}}"
EOH

  destination = "secrets/file.env"
  env         = true
}
```

The task's environment would then have environment variables like the
following:

```text
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
API_KEY=12345678-1234-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc
```

This allows [12factor app](https://12factor.net/config) style environment
variable based configuration while keeping all the familiar features and
semantics of Nomad templates.

Secrets or certificates may contain a wide variety of characters such as
newlines, quotes, and backslashes which may be difficult to quote or escape
properly.

Whenever a templated variable may include special characters, use the `toJSON`
function to ensure special characters are properly parsed by Nomad.

```hcl
CERT_PEM={{ file "path/to/cert.pem" | toJSON }}
```

The parser will read the JSON string, so the `$CERT_PEM` environment variable
will be identical to the contents of the file.

Likewise, when evaluating a password that may contain quotes or `#`, use the
`toJSON` function to ensure Nomad passes the password to the task unchanged.

```hcl
# Passwords may contain any character including special characters like:
#   \"'#
# Use toJSON to ensure Nomad passes them to the environment unchanged.
{{ with secret "secrets/data/application/backend" }}
DB_PASSWD={{ .Data.data.DB_PASSWD | toJSON }}
{{ end }}
```

For more details see [go-envparser's README][go-envparse].

### Template Destinations

Templates are rendered into the task working directory. Drivers without
filesystem isolation (such as `raw_exec`) or drivers that build a chroot in
the task working directory (such as `exec`) can have templates rendered to
arbitrary paths in the task. But task drivers such as `docker` can only access
templates rendered into the `NOMAD_ALLOC_DIR`, `NOMAD_TASK_DIR`, or
`NOMAD_SECRETS_DIR`. To work around this restriction, you can create a mount
from the template `destination` to another location in the task.

```hcl
task "task" {
  driver = "docker"

  config {
    image = "redis:6.0"
    mount {
      type   = "bind"
      source = "local"
      target = "/etc/redis.d"
    }
  }

  template {
    destination = "local/redis.conf"
  }
}
```

## Nomad Integration

### Nomad Services

~> Nomad Services are new in Nomad 1.3.

Nomad service registrations can be queried using the `nomadService` and
`nomadServices` functions. The requests are tied to the same namespace as the
job which contains the template block.

```hcl
  template {
    data = <<EOF
# Configuration for a single NGINX upstream service.
upstream my_app {
  {{- range nomadService "my-app" }}
  server {{ .Address }}:{{ .Port }};{{- end }}
}

# Configuration for all services registered in Nomad as an NGINX upstream
# service.
{{ range nomadServices }}
# Configuration for service {{ .Name }}.
upstream {{ .Name | toLower }} {
  {{- range nomadService .Name }}
  server {{ .Address}}:{{ .Port }};{{- end }}
}
{{ end -}}
EOF

    destination = "local/nginx.conf"
  }
```

### Simple Load Balancing with Nomad Services

~> Simple load balancing with Nomad Services is new in Nomad 1.3.2.

The `nomadService` function now supports simple load balancing by selecting
instances of a service via [rendezvous hashing][rhash].
To enable simple load balancing, the `nomadService` function requires 3 arguments.

- The number of services to select
- The hashing key (should be unique, but consistent per requester)
- The service name

By using `NOMAD_ALLOC_ID` as the hashing key, the selected instances will remain
mostly stable for the allocation. Each time the template is run, `nomadService`
will return the same set of instances for each allocation - unless N instances of
the service are added or removed, in which case there is a 1/N chance of a selected
instance being replaced. This helps maintain a more consistent output when rendering
configuration files, triggering fewer restarts and signaling of Nomad tasks.

```hcl
template {
  data        = <<EOH
# Configuration for 1 redis instances, as assigned via rendezvous hashing.
{{$allocID := env "NOMAD_ALLOC_ID" -}}
{{range nomadService 1 $allocID "redis"}}
  server {{ .Address }}:{{ .Port }};
{{- end}}
EOH
}
```

### Nomad Variables

Nomad [variables] can be queried using the `nomadVar`, `nomadVarList`,
`nomadVarListSafe`, and `nomadVarExists` functions.

#### `nomadVarList` and `nomadVarListSafe`

These functions can be used to list the paths of Nomad variables available to
the task based on its [workload identity]. You can provide an optional prefix to
filter the path list by as a parameter.

The list functions return a slice of `NomadVarMeta` type:

```golang
type NomadVarMeta struct {
  Namespace, Path          string
  CreateIndex, ModifyIndex uint64
  CreateTime, ModifyTime   nanoTime
}
```

The `nanoTime` type contains Unix nanoseconds since the epoch. Its string method
prints it out as a formatted date/time value. It also has a `Time` method that
can be used to retrieve a Go [`time.Time`] for further manipulation.

`NomadVarMeta` objects print their `Path` value when used as a string. For
example, these two template blocks produce identical output.

```hcl
template {
  data        = <<EOH
{{ range nomadVarList }}
  {{ . }}
{{ end }}
EOH
}

template {
  data        = <<EOH
{{ range nomadVarList }}
  {{ .Path }}
{{ end }}
EOH
}
```

You can provide a prefix to filter the path list as an optional parameter to the
`nomadVarList` function.

```hcl
template {
  data        = <<EOH
{{ range nomadVarList "path/to/filter" }}
  {{ . }}
{{ end }}
EOH
}
```

By default, the `nomadVarList` will list variables in the same namespace as the
task. The path filter can change the namespace by adding a suffix separated by
the `@` character:

```hcl
template {
  data        = <<EOH
{{ range nomadVarList "path/to/filter@example_namespace" }}
  {{ . }}
{{ end }}
EOH
}
```

The `nomadVarListSafe` function works identically to `nomadVarList`, but refuses
to render the template if the variable list query returns blank/empty data.

#### `nomadVar`

These functions can be used to a read Nomad variable, assuming the task has
access rights to the variable based on the task's [workload identity]. If the
path does not exist or the caller does not have access to it, the `template`
renderer will block until the path is available. To avoid blocking, wrap
`nomadVar` calls with [`nomadVarExists`](#nomadvarexists).

The `nomadVar` function returns a map of `string` to `NomadVarItems`
structs. Each member of the map corresponds to a member of the variable's
`Items` collection.

For example, given a variable exists at the path `nomad/jobs/redis`, with a
single key/value pair in its Items collection—`maxconns`:`15`

```hcl
template {
  data        = <<EOH
{{ with nomadVar "nomad/jobs/redis" }}{{ .maxconns }}{{ end }}
EOH
}
```

renders

```text
15
```

Each map value also contains helper methods to get the variable metadata and a
link to the parent variable:

- `Keys`: produces a sorted list of keys to this `NomadVarItems` map.

- `Values`: produces a key-sorted list.

- `Tuples`: produces a key-sorted list of K,V tuple structs, with accessors `.K` and `.V` for the key and value respectively.

- `Metadata`: returns this collection's parent metadata as a `NomadVarMeta`

- `Parent`: returns a parent object that has a Metadata field referring to the
  `NomadVarMeta` and an Items field that refers to this `NomadVarItems` object.

For example, given a variable exists at the path `nomad/jobs/redis`, you could
render some of its metadata as follows:

```hcl
template {
  data        = <<EOH
{{ with nomadVar "nomad/jobs/redis" }}
Path:       {{ .Metadata.Path }}
Namespace:  {{ .Metadata.Namespace }}
CreateTime: {{ .Metadata.CreateTime }}
ModifyTime: {{ .Metadata.ModifyTime }}
{{ end }}
EOH
}
```

By default, the `nomadVar` function reads a variable in the same namespace as
the task. The path filter can change the namespace by adding a suffix separated
by the `@` character.

```hcl
template {
  data        = <<EOH
{{ with nomadVar "nomad/jobs/redis@example_namespace" }}{{ .maxconns }}{{ end }}
EOH
}
```

#### `nomadVarExists`

This function can be used to check if a Nomad variable exists at the provided
path, assuming the task has access rights to the variable based on the task's
[workload identity]. If a variable exists, this will return true, false
otherwise. Unlike [`nomadVar`](#nomadvar), this function will not block if the
variable does not exist, which can be useful for controlling flow.

For example:

```hcl
template {
  data        = <<EOH
{{ if nomadVarExists "app/beta_active" }}
  # ...
{{ else }}
  # ...
{{ end }}
EOH
}
```

## Consul Integration

### Consul KV

Consul KV values can be accessed using the [`key`][ct_api_key] function to
retrieve a single value from a key path. The [`ls`][ct_api_ls] function can be
used to retrieve all keys in a path. For deeply nested paths, use the
[`tree`][ct_api_tree] function.

```hcl
  template {
    data = <<EOF
# Read single key from Consul KV.
APP_NAME = "{{key "app/name"}}"

# Read all keys in the path `app/environment` from Consul KV.
{{range ls "app/environment"}}
{{.Key}}={{.Value}}
{{end}}
    EOF

    destination = "local/env"
    env         = true
  }
```

### Consul Services

The Consul service catalog can be queried using the [`service`][ct_api_service]
and [`services`][ct_api_services] functions. For Connect-capable services, use
the [`connect`][ct_api_connect] function.

```hcl
  template {
    data = <<EOF
# Configuration for a single upstream service.
upstream my_app {
  {{- range service "my-app" }}
  server {{ .Address }}:{{ .Port }};{{- end }}
}

# Configuration for all services in the catalog.
{{ range services }}
# Configuration for service {{ .Name }}.
upstream {{ .Name | toLower }} {
  {{- range service .Name }}
  server {{ .Address}}:{{ .Port }};{{- end }}
}
{{ end -}}
    EOF

    destination = "local/nginx.conf"
  }
```

## Vault Integration

### PKI Certificate

Vault is a popular open source tool for managing secrets. In addition to acting
as an encrypted KV store, Vault can also generate dynamic secrets, like PKI/TLS
certificates.

When generating PKI certificates with Vault, the certificate, private key, and
any intermediate certs are all returned as part of the same API call. Most
software requires these files be placed in separate files on the system.

~> **Note**: `generate_lease` must be set to `true` (non-default) on the Vault
PKI role.<br /><br /> Failure to do so will cause the template to frequently
render a new certificate, approximately every minute. This creates a significant
number of certificates to be expired in Vault and could ultimately lead to Vault
performance impacts and failures.

#### As individual files

For templates, all dependencies are mapped into a single list. This means that
multiple templates watching the same path return the same data.

```hcl
template {
  data = <<EOH
{{ with secret "pki/issue/foo" "common_name=foo.service.consul" "ip_sans=127.0.0.1" }}
{{- .Data.certificate -}}
{{ end }}
EOH
  destination   = "${NOMAD_SECRETS_DIR}/certificate.crt"
  change_mode   = "restart"
}

template {
  data = <<EOH
{{ with secret "pki/issue/foo" "common_name=foo.service.consul" "ip_sans=127.0.0.1" }}
{{- .Data.issuing_ca -}}
{{ end }}
EOH
  destination   = "${NOMAD_SECRETS_DIR}/ca.crt"
  change_mode   = "restart"
}

template {
  data = <<EOH
{{ with secret "pki/issue/foo" "common_name=foo.service.consul" "ip_sans=127.0.0.1" }}
{{- .Data.private_key -}}
{{ end }}
EOH
  destination   = "${NOMAD_SECRETS_DIR}/private_key.key"
  change_mode   = "restart"
}
```

These are three different input templates, but when run under the Nomad job,
they are compressed into a single call, sharing the resulting data.

#### As a PEM formatted file

This example acquires a PKI certificate from Vault in PEM format, concatenates
the elements into a bundle, and stores it into your application's secret
directory.

```hcl
template {
  data = <<EOH
{{ with secret "pki/issue/foo" "common_name=foo.service.consul" "ip_sans=127.0.0.1" "format=pem" }}
{{ .Data.certificate }}
{{ .Data.issuing_ca }}
{{ .Data.private_key }}{{ end }}
EOH
  destination   = "${NOMAD_SECRETS_DIR}/bundle.pem"
  change_mode   = "restart"
}
```

### Vault KV API v1

Under Vault KV API v1, paths start with `secret/`, and the response returns the
raw key/value data. This secret was set using
`vault kv put secret/aws/s3 aws_access_key_id=somekeyid`.

```hcl
  template {
    data = <<EOF
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "{{with secret "secret/aws/s3"}}{{.Data.aws_access_key_id}}{{end}}"
    EOF
  }
```

Note that if the name of a secret includes the `-` character, you must access
it by index. This secret was set using `vault kv put secret/app db-password=somepassword`.

```hcl
  template {
    data = <<EOF
      DB_PASSWORD = "{{with secret "secret/app"}}{{index .Data "db-password"}}{{end}}"
    EOF
  }
```

### Vault KV API v2

Under Vault KV API v2, paths start with `secret/data/`, and the response returns
metadata in addition to key/value data. This secret was set using
`vault kv put secret/aws/s3 aws_access_key_id=somekeyid`.

```hcl
  template {
    data = <<EOF
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "{{with secret "secret/data/aws/s3"}}{{.Data.data.aws_access_key_id}}{{end}}"
    EOF
  }
```

Notice the addition of `data` in both the path and the field accessor string.
Additionally, when using the Vault v2 API, the Vault policies applied to your
Nomad jobs will need to grant permissions to `read` under `secret/data/...`
rather than `secret/...`.

Like KV API v1, if the name of a secret includes the `-` character, you must
access it by index. This secret was set using
`vault kv put secret/app db-password=somepassword`.

```hcl
  template {
    data = <<EOF
      DB_PASSWORD = "{{with secret "secret/data/app"}}{{index .Data.data "db-password"}}{{end}}"
    EOF
  }
```

## Client Configuration

The `template` block has the following [client configuration
options](/nomad/docs/configuration/client#options):

- `function_denylist` `([]string: ["plugin"])` - Specifies a list of template
  rendering functions that should be disallowed in job specs. By default, the
  `plugin` function is disallowed as it allows running arbitrary commands on
  the host as root (unless Nomad is configured to run as a non-root user).

- `disable_file_sandbox` `(bool: false)` - Allows templates access to arbitrary
  files on the client host via the `file` function. By default, templates can
  access files only within the [task working directory].
