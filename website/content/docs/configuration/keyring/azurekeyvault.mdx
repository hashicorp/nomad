# `azurekeyvault` keyring

The AWS KMS keyring configures Nomad to use AWS KMS to wrap its keyring. This
example shows configuring Azure Key Vault keyring through the Nomad
configuration file by providing all the required values.

```hcl
seal "azurekeyvault" {
  active = true
  name   = "example"

  # fields specific to azurekeyvault
  tenant_id      = "46646709-b63e-4747-be42-516edeaf1e14"
  client_id      = "03dc33fc-16d9-4b77-8152-3ec568f8af6e"
  client_secret  = "DUJDS3..."
  vault_name     = "nomad"
  key_name       = "nomad_key"
}
```

## `azurekeyvault` parameters

These parameters apply to the `keyring` block in the Nomad configuration file:

- `tenant_id` `(string: <required>)`: The tenant id for the Azure Active
  Directory organization. Alternately specify via the `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
  environment variable.

- `client_id` `(string: <required or MSI>)`: The client id for credentials to
  query the Azure APIs. Alternately specify via the `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
  environment variable.

- `client_secret` `(string: <required or MSI>)`: The client secret for
  credentials to query the Azure APIs. Alternately specify via the
  `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable.

- `environment` `(string: "AZUREPUBLICCLOUD")`: The Azure Cloud environment API
  endpoints to use. Alternately specify via the `AZURE_ENVIRONMENT` environment
  variable.

- `vault_name` `(string: <required>)`: The Key Vault vault to use the encryption
  keys for encryption and decryption.

- `key_name` `(string: <required>)`: The Key Vault key to use for encryption and
  decryption.

- `resource` `(string: "vault.azure.net")`: The AZ KeyVault resource's DNS
  Suffix to connect to. Alternately specify via the `AZURE_AD_RESOURCE`
  environment variable. Needs to be changed to connect to Azure's Managed HSM
  KeyVault instance type.

## Authentication

You must provide authentication-related values either as environment variables
or as configuration parameters.

Azure authentication values:

- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `AZURE_ENVIRONMENT`
- `AZURE_AD_RESOURCE`

~> **Note:** If Nomad is hosted on Azure, Nomad can use Managed Service
Identities (MSI) to access Azure instead of an environment and shared client id
and secret. MSI must be [enabled][msi_enabled] on the VMs hosting Nomad. We
recommend this configuration since MSI prevents your Azure credentials from
being stored as clear text.

-> **Note:** If you are using a Managed HSM KeyVault, you must specify
`AZURE_AD_RESOURCE` or the `resource` configuration parameter; usually this
should point to `managedhsm.azure.net` but could point to other suffixes
depending on Azure environment.

## Key rotation

This keyring supports rotating keys defined in Azure Key Vault. Key metadata is
stored with the encrypted data to ensure the correct key is used during
decryption operations. Set up Azure Key Vault with [key rotation][] using Azure
Automation Account so Vault recognizes newly rotated keys.
