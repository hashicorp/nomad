# `group` block in the job specification

<Placement groups={['job', 'group']} />

The `group` block defines a series of tasks that should be co-located on the
same Nomad client. Any [task][] within a group will be placed on the same
client.

```hcl
job "docs" {
  group "example" {
    # ...
  }
}
```

## Parameters

- `constraint` <code>([Constraint][]: nil)</code> -
  This can be provided multiple times to define additional constraints.

- `affinity` <code>([Affinity][]: nil)</code> - This can be provided
  multiple times to define preferred placement criteria.

- `spread` <code>([Spread][spread]: nil)</code> - This can be provided
  multiple times to define criteria for spreading allocations across a
  node attribute or metadata. See the
  [Nomad spread reference](/nomad/docs/job-specification/spread) for more details.

- `count` `(int)` - Specifies the number of instances that should be running
  under for this group. This value must be non-negative. This defaults to the
  `min` value specified in the [`scaling`](/nomad/docs/job-specification/scaling)
  block, if present; otherwise, this defaults to `1`.

- `consul` <code>([Consul][consul]: nil)</code> - Specifies Consul configuration
  options specific to the group. These options will be applied to all tasks and
  services in the group unless a task has its own `consul` block.

- `ephemeral_disk` <code>([EphemeralDisk][]: nil)</code> - Specifies the
  ephemeral disk requirements of the group. Ephemeral disks can be marked as
  sticky and support live data migrations.

- `disconnect` <code>([disconnect][]: nil)</code> - Specifies the disconnect
  strategy for the server and client for all tasks in this group in case of a
  network partition. The tasks can be left unconnected, stopped or replaced
  when the client disconnects. The policy for reconciliation in case the client
  regains connectivity is also specified here.

- `meta` <code>([Meta][]: nil)</code> - Specifies a key-value map that annotates
  with user-defined metadata.

- `migrate` <code>([Migrate][]: nil)</code> - Specifies the group strategy for
  migrating off of draining nodes. Only service jobs with a count greater than
  1 support migrate blocks.

- `network` <code>([Network][]: &lt;optional&gt;)</code> - Specifies the network
  requirements and configuration, including static and dynamic port allocations,
  for the group.

- `reschedule` <code>([Reschedule][]: nil)</code> - Allows to specify a
  rescheduling strategy. Nomad will then attempt to schedule the task on another
  node if any of the group allocation statuses become "failed".

- `restart` <code>([Restart][]: nil)</code> - Specifies the restart policy for
  all tasks in this group. If omitted, a default policy exists for each job
  type, which can be found in the [restart block documentation][restart].

- `service` <code>([Service][]: nil)</code> - Specifies integrations with Nomad
  or [Consul](/nomad/docs/configuration/consul) for service discovery. Nomad
  automatically registers each service when an allocation is started and
  de-registers them when the allocation is destroyed.

- `shutdown_delay` `(string: "0s")` - Specifies the duration to wait when
  stopping a group's tasks. The delay occurs between Consul or Nomad service
  deregistration and sending each task a shutdown signal. Ideally, services
  would fail health checks once they receive a shutdown signal. Alternatively,
  `shutdown_delay` may be set to give in-flight requests time to complete
  before shutting down. A group level `shutdown_delay` will run regardless
  if there are any defined group [services](/nomad/docs/job-specification/group#service)
  and only applies to these services. In addition, tasks may have their own
  [`shutdown_delay`](/nomad/docs/job-specification/task#shutdown_delay) which waits
  between de-registering task services and stopping the task.

- `task` <code>([Task][]: &lt;required&gt;)</code> - Specifies one or more tasks to run
  within this group. This can be specified multiple times, to add a task as part
  of the group.

- `update` <code>([Update][update]: nil)</code> - Specifies the task's update
  strategy. When omitted, a default update strategy is applied.

- `vault` <code>([Vault][]: nil)</code> - Specifies the set of Vault policies
  required by all tasks in this group. Overrides a `vault` block set at the
  `job` level.

- `volume` <code>([Volume][]: nil)</code> - Specifies the volumes that are
  required by tasks within the group.

## Examples

The following examples only show the `group` blocks. Remember that the
`group` block is only valid in the placements listed above.

### Specifying Count

This example specifies that 5 instances of the tasks within this group should be
running:

```hcl
group "example" {
  count = 5
}
```

### Tasks with constraint

This example shows two abbreviated tasks with a constraint on the group. This
will restrict the tasks to 64-bit operating systems.

```hcl
group "example" {
  constraint {
    attribute = "${attr.cpu.arch}"
    value     = "amd64"
  }

  task "cache" {
    # ...
  }

  task "server" {
    # ...
  }
}
```

### Metadata

This example show arbitrary user-defined metadata on the group:

```hcl
group "example" {
  meta {
    my-key = "my-value"
  }
}
```

### Network

This example shows network constraints as specified in the [network][] block
which uses the `bridge` networking mode, dynamically allocates two ports, and
statically allocates one port:

```hcl
group "example" {
  network {
    mode = "bridge"
    port "http" {}
    port "https" {}
    port "lb" {
      static = "8889"
    }
  }
}
```

### Service discovery

This example creates a service in Consul. To read more about service discovery
in Nomad, please see the [Nomad service discovery documentation][service_discovery].

```hcl
group "example" {
  network {
    port "api" {}
  }

  service {
    name = "example"
    port = "api"
    tags = ["default"]

    check {
      type     = "tcp"
      interval = "10s"
      timeout  = "2s"
    }
  }

  task "api" { ... }
}
```
