# Nomad Operator

Command: `nomad operator`

The `operator` command provides cluster-level tools for Nomad operators, such
as interacting with the Raft subsystem. This was added in Nomad 0.5.5.

~> Use this command with extreme caution, as improper use could lead to a Nomad
outage and even loss of data.

See the [Outage Recovery](/guides/outage.html) guide for some examples of how
this command is used. For an API to perform these operations programatically,
please see the documentation for the [Operator](/guides/outage.html)
endpoint.
