# Frequently Asked Questions

## Q: Can I get a quick summary of the Nomad changes?

Sure - check out the Enterprise Licenses portion of the [upgrade guide](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/upgrade/upgrade-specific#enterprise-licenses)

## Q: Does this affect Nomad OSS or older versions of Nomad?
No. This change is on 1.1.0+ent and later.


## Q: When is this change being released?

The 1.1.0+ent beta was released on May 3rd 2021.

The 1.1.0+ent will go GA on May 18th 2021 (unless blocking bugs are found in the beta process).

## Q: Does the license have to be present on Nomad client nodes?

No. Only Nomad server nodes need to have the license present.

Nomad agents running with the “-dev” flag will also need a license (as they are running a server agent).

## Q: What are some pitfalls an ops person/operator/SRE/etc could experiency by up an upgrade because of this?

If you follow the steps in the [upgrade guide](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/upgrade/upgrade-specific#enterprise-licenses), but have misconfigured the licensing steps, the server instances will stop the boot-up sequence. 

If you do not check cluster health after adding new servers, and verify that the new servers have joined properly, then you may accidentally take down old servers without replacing them.

If you are using a trial license in production, this could cause issues as the cluster will fail start once the trial expires.

If you have built automation around `nomad license put`, this command will fail as it has been removed from Nomad v1.1.0+.

## Q: What are some other gotchas?

Operators at a company might not have access to the company's normal Nomad license. 
The operators may be relying on the now-removed 6-hour window in order to do daily work with Nomad. 
Running `nomad agent -dev` will fail for these users. In this case, they should get a trial license via the [trial license page](http://nomadproject.io/trial).

## Q: How can a user get their existing license to put on disk for an upgrade?

Use `nomad license get` to retrieve the license, then save the license to disk.

## Q: What happens when a license expires?
If a license expires after the server instance is joined to the cluster, the existing behavior is preserved: disallow Enterprise feature operations until a grace period expires, at which point the Nomad servers shut down. 
The grace period will be one day.

## Q: Will on-prem binaries with “baked-in” licenses work?

Yes. They will work as if they had a standard autoloaded license.


## Q: Are license files cluster-specific or node-specific?

No. Licenses can be reused on different nodes and different clusters.

## Q: Where can users get a trial license for Nomad?
Visit http://nomadproject.io/trial for a free 30-day trial license.

## Q: When a Nomad client agent restarts, will it still need a license file?

Yes. Every time `nomad agent` runs as a server (or in -dev), it requires a license on disk.

## Q: Will Nomad downgrades/rollbacks work?

When downgrading to a version of Nomad before 1.1.0, customers will need to follow the old  process for applying enterprise licenses to Nomad. 
This is detailed in the [0.12 portion of the upgrade guide](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/upgrade/upgrade-specific#enterprise-licensing). Enterprise features will be enabled for 6 hours. 
During that time enterprise users should apply their license with the “nomad license put” command. 
Licenses will not be autoloaded from the file system in earlier versions of Nomad.

## Q: Is there a tutorial available for the license enablement?
