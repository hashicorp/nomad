# /v1/operator

The `/operator` endpoint provides cluster-level tools for Nomad operators, such
as interacting with the Raft subsystem.

~> Use this interface with extreme caution, as improper use could lead to a
Nomad outage and even loss of data.

See the [Outage Recovery](https://learn.hashicorp.com/nomad/operating-nomad/outage) guide for some examples of how
these capabilities are used. For a CLI to perform these operations manually,
please see the documentation for the
[`nomad operator`](/docs/commands/operator) command.

## Read Raft Configuration

This endpoint queries the status of a client node registered with Nomad.

| Method | Path                              | Produces           |
| ------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/v1/operator/raft/configuration` | `application/json` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/api-docs#blocking-queries) and
[required ACLs](/api-docs#acls).

| Blocking Queries | ACL Required |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| `NO`             | `management` |

### Parameters

- `stale` - Specifies if the cluster should respond without an active leader.
  This is specified as a query string parameter.

### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    https://localhost:4646/v1/operator/raft/configuration
```

### Sample Response

```json
{
  "Index": 1,
  "Servers": [
    {
      "Address": "127.0.0.1:4647",
      "ID": "127.0.0.1:4647",
      "Leader": true,
      "Node": "bacon-mac.global",
      "RaftProtocol": 2,
      "Voter": true
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Field Reference

- `Index` `(int)` - The `Index` value is the Raft corresponding to this
  configuration. The latest configuration may not yet be committed if changes
  are in flight.

- `Servers` `(array: Server)` - The returned `Servers` array has information
  about the servers in the Raft peer configuration.

  - `ID` `(string)` - The ID of the server. This is the same as the `Address`
    but may be upgraded to a GUID in a future version of Nomad.

  - `Node` `(string)` - The node name of the server, as known to Nomad, or
    `"(unknown)"` if the node is stale and not known.

  - `Address` `(string)` - The `ip:port` for the server.

  - `Leader` `(bool)` - is either "true" or "false" depending on the server's
    role in the Raft configuration.

  - `Voter` `(bool)` - is "true" or "false", indicating if the server has a vote
    in the Raft configuration. Future versions of Nomad may add support for
    non-voting servers.

## Remove Raft Peer

This endpoint removes a Nomad server with given address from the Raft
configuration. The return code signifies success or failure.

- `FailureTolerance` is the number of redundant healthy servers that could be
  fail without causing an outage (this would be 2 in a healthy cluster of 5
  servers).

- `Servers` holds detailed health information on each server:

  - `ID` is the Raft ID of the server.

  - `Name` is the node name of the server.

  - `Address` is the address of the server.

  - `SerfStatus` is the SerfHealth check status for the server.

  - `Version` is the Nomad version of the server.

  - `Leader` is whether this server is currently the leader.

  - `LastContact` is the time elapsed since this server's last contact with the leader.

  - `LastTerm` is the server's last known Raft leader term.

  - `LastIndex` is the index of the server's last committed Raft log entry.

  - `Healthy` is whether the server is healthy according to the current Autopilot configuration.

  - `Voter` is whether the server is a voting member of the Raft cluster.

  - `StableSince` is the time this server has been in its current `Healthy` state.

  The HTTP status code will indicate the health of the cluster. If `Healthy` is true, then a
  status of 200 will be returned. If `Healthy` is false, then a status of 429 will be returned.

## Generate Snapshot

This endpoint generates and returns an atomic, point-in-time snapshot of the
Nomad server state for disaster recovery. Snapshots include all state managed by Nomad's
Raft [consensus protocol](/docs/internals/consensus).


Snapshots are exposed as gzipped tar archives which internally contain the Raft
metadata required to restore, as well as a binary serialized version of the
Nomad server state. The contents are covered internally by SHA-256 hashes.
These hashes are verified during snapshot restore operations. The structure of
the archive is internal to Nomad and not intended to be used other than for
restore operations. The archives are not designed to be modified before a
restore.

| Method | Path                    | Produces                 |
| :----- | :---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/v1/operator/snapshot` | `200 application/x-gzip` |


The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/api-docs#blocking-queries) and
[required ACLs](/api-docs#acls).

| Blocking Queries | ACL Required |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| `NO`             | `management` |

### Parameters

- `stale` - Specifies if the cluster should respond without an active leader.
  This is specified as a query string parameter.

### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    -o snapshot.tgz \
    http://127.0.0.1:4646/v1/operator/snapshot
```

The above example results in a tarball named `snapshot.tgz` in the current working directory.

## Restore Snapshot

This endpoint restores a point-in-time snapshot of the Nomad server state.

Restores involve a potentially dangerous low-level Raft operation that is not
designed to handle server failures during a restore. This operation is primarily
intended to be used when recovering from a disaster, restoring into a fresh
cluster of Nomad servers.

The body of the request should be a snapshot archive returned from a previous
call to the `GET` method.

| Method | Path                    | Produces                      |
| :----- | :---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `PUT`  | `/v1/operator/snapshot` | `200 text/plain (empty body)` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/api-docs#blocking-queries) and
[required ACLs](/api-docs#acls).

| Blocking Queries | ACL Required |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| `NO`             | `management` |

### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --request PUT \
    --data-binary @snapshot.tgz \
    http://127.0.0.1:4646/v1/operator/snapshot
```

~> Some tools default to www/encoded uploads. Nomad expects the snapshot to be
in pure binary form.
