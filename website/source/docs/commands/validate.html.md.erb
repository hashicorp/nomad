# Command: validate

The `validate` command is used to check a [HCL job specification](/docs/job-specification/index.html)
for any syntax errors or validation problems.

## Usage

```
nomad validate <file>
```

The validate command requires a single argument, specifying the path to a file
containing a [HCL job specification](/docs/job-specification/index.html). This file
will be read and the job checked for any problems. If the
supplied path is "-", the job file is read from STDIN. Otherwise it is read
from the file at the supplied path or downloaded and read from URL specified.
Nomad downloads the job file using [`go-getter`](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter)
and supports `go-getter` syntax.

On successful validation, exit code 0 will be returned, otherwise an exit code
of 1 indicates an error.

## Examples

Validate a job with invalid syntax:

```
$ nomad validate example.nomad
Job validation errors:
1 error(s) occurred:

* group "cache" -> task "redis" -> config: 1 error(s) occurred:

* field "image" is required
```

Validate a job that has a configuration that causes warnings:

```
$ nomad validate example.nomad
Job Warnings:
1 warning(s):

* Group "cache" has warnings: 1 error(s) occurred:

* Update max parallel count is greater than task group count (6 > 3). A destructive change would result in the simultaneous replacement of all allocations.

Job validation successful
```
