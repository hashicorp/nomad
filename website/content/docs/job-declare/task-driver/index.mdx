## Nomad task drivers

The Nomad binary contains several bundled task drivers. We also support
additional task driver plugins that you may install separately.

| Bundled with Nomad   | Plugins               |
|----------------------|-----------------------|
| [Docker]             | [Exec2]               |
| [Isolated Fork/Exec] | [Podman]              |
| [Java]               | [Virt]                |
| [QEMU]               |                       |
| [Raw Fork/Exec]      |                       |
