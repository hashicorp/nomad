Permanently add a new location to your path by editing your shell's settings
file (usually called something like `~/.bashrc`, where the part of the filename
after the `.` and before `rc` is the name of your shell). In that file you
should see a line that starts with `export PATH=`, followed by a
colon-separated list of locations. Add the location of the Nomad binary to that
list and save the file. Then reload your shell's configuration with the command
`source ~/.bashrc`, replacing `bash` with the name of your shell.
