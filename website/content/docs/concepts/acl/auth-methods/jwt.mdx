# JSON Web Token (JWT) Auth Method

The `jwt` auth method can be used to authenticate with Nomad by providing a
[JWT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) directly. The JWT is
cryptographically verified using locally-provided keys, or, if configured, an
OIDC Discovery service can be used to fetch the appropriate keys.

See [auth-method create] for the parameters required to create a JWT auth-method with a given verification method.

## JWT Verification

JWT signatures will be verified against public keys from the issuer. This
process can be done one of three ways:

- **Static Keys** - A set of public keys is stored directly in the
  configuration.

- **JWKS** - A JSON Web Key Set ([JWKS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517))
  URL (and optional certificate chain) is configured. Keys will be fetched from
  this endpoint during authentication.

- **OIDC Discovery** - An OIDC Discovery URL (and optional certificate chain)
  is configured. Keys will be fetched from this URL during authentication. When
  OIDC Discovery is used, OIDC validation criteria (e.g. `iss`, `aud`, etc.)
  will be applied.

If multiple methods are needed, another auth method of this type may be created
with a different name.
