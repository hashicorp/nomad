# Command: operator snapshot redact


The `operator snapshot redact` command removes key material from an existing
snapshot file created by the `operator snapshot save` command, when using the
AEAD keyring provider.

This is useful for situations where you need to transmit a snapshot without
exposing key material.

<Warning>

When using a [KMS keyring provider][], no cleartext key material is stored in
snapshots and this command is not necessary. Note that this command requires
loading the entire snapshot into memory locally and overwrites the existing
snapshot.

Snapshots made before Nomad 1.9.0 will not include the keyrings.

</Warning>

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad operator snapshot redact <file>
```


[KMS keyring provider]: /nomad/docs/configuration/keyring
