# Command: job init
**Alias: `nomad init`**

The `job init` command creates an example [job specification][jobspec] in the
current directory that demonstrates some common configurations for tasks, task
groups, runtime constraints, and resource allocation.

Please refer to the [jobspec][] and [drivers](/docs/drivers/index.html)
pages to learn how to customize the template.

## Init Options

 * `-short`: If set, a minimal jobspec without comments is emitted.
 * `-connect`: If set, the jobspec includes Consul Connect integration.

## Examples

Generate an example job file:

```text
$ nomad job init
Example job file written to example.nomad
```
