# Using Nomad with the Web UI

The Nomad Web UI offers an easy to use web experience for inspecting a Nomad cluster. It's built
into the Nomad binary and is served alongside the API. With zero additional configuration, you can
use the Web UI instead of the CLI to inspect cluster state and submit and manage jobs.
