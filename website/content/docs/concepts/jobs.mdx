# Jobs

A Job is a specification provided by users that declares a workload for
Nomad. A Job is a form of _desired state_; the user is expressing that the
job should be running, but not where it should be run. The responsibility of
Nomad is to make sure the _actual state_ matches your desired state. A
Job is composed of one or more task groups.

Jobs are submitted by users and represent a desired state. A job is a
declarative description of tasks to run which are bounded by constraints and
require resources. Jobs can also have affinities which are used to express
placement preferences. Nodes are the servers in the clusters that tasks can be
scheduled on. The mapping of tasks in a job to nodes is done using allocations.
An allocation is used to declare that a set of tasks in a job should be run on a
particular node. Scheduling is the process of determining the appropriate
allocations and is done as part of an evaluation. Deployments are objects to
track a rolling update of allocations between two versions of a job.

## Types




### Batch

### Service

### System batch



## Deployment strategies

Nomad supports rolling, blue/green, and canary deployment strategies for your
jobs. Refer to [Nomad job update
strategies](nomad/tutorials/job-updates/job-update-strategies)
for detailed explanations and configuration instructions.

## Statuses

A single status to indicate how a job is doing, based on running/healthy allocations vs desired.
   * Possible statuses are:
   * - Deploying: A deployment is actively taking place
   * - Complete: (Batch/Sysbatch only) All expected allocations are complete
   * - Running: (Batch/Sysbatch only) All expected allocations are running
   * - Healthy: All expected allocations are running and healthy
   * - Recovering: Some allocations are pending
   * - Degraded: A deployment is not taking place, and some allocations are failed, lost, or unplaced
   * - Failed: All allocations are failed, lost, or unplaced
   * - Removed: The job appeared in our initial query, but has since been garbage collected (user's been on the page for awhile)
   * - Stopped: The job has been manually stopped (and not purged or yet garbage collected) by a user
